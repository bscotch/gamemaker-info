            "We have also moved to a new build system in order to get even more rapid turnaround on our new versions and confirming bug fixes, etc., also to support the future LTS versions talked about on our recent 2022 update video",
            "NOTE: As part of this massive update to all of our toolchain, you cannot use runtimes from these new versions with older IDEs / older runtimes with these newer IDEs - you must be using a current runtime with the current IDE, otherwise you will see your builds get stuck with the timer carrying on endlessly and in your ui.log you will simply be told “your runtime tools are missing or corrupt”"

            "Game Options: Completely removed the Amazon Fire section - it has been redundant/legacy information for quite a while, as Amazon Fire target was removed, and so we have now removed the ability to see that content inside the IDE",
            "Game Options: XDK/Xbox One's \"Program ID\" field now support general text, rather than only GUIDs - which is compliant with current submission requirements, but does mean you need to always check the values you’re using here, as the field will no longer detect formatting errors",
            "General: GM could hang when there was a massive burst of debug logging output from a game, so there is now a cap on the maximum amount of logging which will be output each IDE tick - this will stop any hangs, but for games which log huge amounts of information you may see a slight delay before the logging appears",

            "Fixed a very important project-saving bug where if a script's source file had become locked (e.g., by an external process such as source control or Dropbox/GDrive/OneDrive, etc.) and therefore wasn't able to be read, then it was possible that Feather would incorrectly cause some <i>other</i> assets to be lost (typically Scripts, but not limited to this)",
            "Project loading will now also merge duplicate folders whenever they are detected in a .yyp file - so if you had a project which for some reason had gained duplicate folders in the Asset Browser, you should now find that simply opening the project in this version will clean that up (if you know that you have a project in this state it’s worth creating a backup before you open it, so that if you do have any issues you can send us the original version for investigation)",
            "Creating a new event in the Object Editor will now trigger an immediate save of your project, as this fixes multiple issues with source control status, but also when discarding other unsaved changes on closing GameMaker",

            "Fixed some memory management around loading assets, which will stop potential leaks and also fixes an issue with breakpoints failing to stay on the correct line in Object events if you later add other lines higher up in your code",

            "This change also fixes a long-time compiler issue where projects containing rooms with lots of tile slots could see a pause on the line \"Found Project Format 2\" in their output log",
            "However, this new format is not compatible with older IDEs/runtimes and so accordingly we have introduced a new safeguard in this version, should you attempt to open a project in an older IDE again.",

            "The next time a room containing a tile layer is edited in the newer IDE, this will potentially upgrade all the tile data and save it in a \"TileCompressedData'' variable in the room’s own .yyp file - at this point, this project cannot be loaded into previous IDEs as it won’t understand its tile layer information. (Any game built by the 2022.8 or later IDEs, but using a runtime from 2022.6 or older will also lack all this tile layer’s content, so please be careful using older runtimes.)",

            "Added support for Android's \"ProGuard\" minifying and shrinking options, both of which can be used to reduce your game’s output package size and therefore the amount of data new players need to download when installing your game. You can now enable these settings in Game Options if you wish (they both default to off) and the corresponding steps will then be performed during your builds. Note that you cannot enable \"shrinkResources\" without also having \"minifyEnabled\" enabled, as the Android tools do not allow that (minify on its own is allowed). We also added $YYAndroidProguard as a tag so that your extensions can inject into the proguard.pro file.",
            "Made a fix where GM could crash when adding multiple files at once to the Included Files “Datafiles” directory outside GameMaker, but please note that the fix for this one means <i>empty</i> folders will no longer be shown in the Included Files editor window - they are still on disk just fine, but they won’t appear until you actually add some files into them",
            "Fixed that duplicating a layer in the Room Editor did not preserve all of its instances’ creation code on the new layer you made and so you had to copy the code manually later - now, all the code is copied for you, as you would expect",
            "The font used for Chinese in the Mac IDE has now been subtly changed, as the one we used is no longer included by Apple in recent macOS versions and so this could cause a number of issues when trying to draw font characters in various places within GameMaker",
            "When building projects, all .zip output packages have been changed to be encoded as UTF-8, which stops issues when non-ASCII characters have been typed in Included Files folder names (files inside that folder would then fail to be found in-game)"

            "Building Projects: [Mac IDE] macOS YYC builds will no longer incorrectly claim a success <i>for the run part</i> when targeting a different CPU architecture to the local machine [the build itself should work fine, but as you’re using the wrong CPU it’s correct that the run part will always fail to launch the game]",

(The project would also lack all the tiles information if you used a current IDE but with a runtime from 2022.6 or older.)",
