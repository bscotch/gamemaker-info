      "<h2>Changes Since 2022.9.1.51</h2>",
      "<h3>Bugs Fixed</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Increased the number of retries when a runtime fails to download and added a 2-second pause between each retry, so GM should no longer get stuck for a long time on the progress bar</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Now alerts you when two functions are declared with the same name in a single script/event, as this has always been a compile fail</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Code referencing asset names is now updated correctly when those asset are renamed in the Asset Browser (if you have this Preference enabled)</li>",
      "</ul>",

      "<h2>2022.9.1.51</h2>",
      "<h3>Opera Account Settings Migration</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>In previous releases, if you used one email address for your GameMaker account and a different email for your Opera Account and you have already converted your GameMaker account to be an Opera account on our website, then this would cause your Preferences and Recent Projects, etc., to be “lost”, because GameMaker is now looking in a new folder for them</li>",
      "\t<li>This version will rename the original folder for you and avoid you having to “migrate” your settings manually; however, it will only do this if you have not converted already - if you have already converted your account and so this issue applies to you, please see <a href=\"https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/6893026074525\" target=\"_blank\">our FAQ for how to quickly and easily recover your settings</a></li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Changes To The Default Project Layout</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>The default project layout now includes the Inspector as a new left-hand dock (but of course it is freely movable and dockable) and no longer includes Recent Windows as a panel inside the right-hand dock</li>",
      "\t<li>Though the Inspector has been around for a long time already, we are now bringing it to the front and making it more relevant inside other editors</li>",
      "\t<li>Please note that any existing layouts in your projects are of course unaffected by this change, and so if you want to see the changes you can use Layout -> Reset Layout menubar option. (If you have a highly customised layout you use in your projects you may also want to use Save Layout and ensure you backup your current layout.)</li>",
      "\t<li>Recent Windows can still be opened from the Windows menubar entry and added to your project layout again if you wish</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Changes To How GameMaker Loads/Saves Game Options</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Up until now, GameMaker always treated the licence of the last person to open a project as <i>the definitive list of game options that project requires</i> - so if one team member has a lot of targets on their licence all of them would be configured and if the project was then shared with a new team member who only had Test, a lot of those options would be removed again</li>",
      "\t<li>Now, your options will “merge” - so if you have team members who have different licence types, the Game Options values will remain in the project and cover everyone’s licences</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>New Room Inspector And Changes To The Room Editor Layout</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>The new Room Inspector is how you will now access many of the settings for rooms</li>",
      "\t<li>Before, all of a room’s settings and its layers were cramped into a single panel; now, all of the settings are handled as part of the Inspector and the Layers panel is a dockable panel which can be detached and placed where you want</li>",
      "\t<li>The Inspector UI is also more dynamic/responsive and only shows certain functionality if it’s relevant (e.g., Inheritance settings are only shown in the Inspector if you are in a child room, rather than always being shown in the old Room Editor layout)</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>”Opera GX” Target Rebranded As “GX.games”</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>The target has always been part of a whole ecosystem of releasing your games on the GX.games site and sharing them with others (for free or as paid content), so this new name clarifies that</li>",
      "\t<li>If you have not had a look at <a href=\"https://gx.games\" target=\"_blank\">GX.games</a> and what it offers, please do check it out and play a few games, see if it’s a route you would like to take also</li>",
      "\t<li>You already have access to publish games on it (for free) as part of your Opera Account and you can also see <a href=\"https://gamemaker.io/en/tutorials/publish-to-gxgames-tutorial\" target=\"_blank\">our tutorial about what publishing on GX.games involves</a> if you want more info</li>",
      "\t<li>Also added a new \"os_gxgames\" constant (which duplicates the existing \"os_operagx\", so you do not need to change existing code) in order to be consistent in-game with this branding change</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>New Options For Texture Group Management</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>You will now find the texture groups editor has new controls for whether you want to split textures off into their own data files on disk during your builds, as this can be required by bigger games on some platforms which have memory caps on how much data you can have loaded at any moment (e.g., GX.games only allows 2GB)</li>",
      "\t<li>You can then use the matching 2022.9 runtimes to load/unload these groups in-game as you require</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>New Visual Node “Add Motion”</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>This new function takes a direction and speed and modifies the in-built hspeed and vspeed values accordingly - so you have the one node to manage, but can change several values at once behind-the-scenes (the node performs the following code: <i>hspeed += speed * dcos(direction); vspeed += speed * -dsin(direction);</i>)</li>",
      "\t<li>The new node will be part of an upcoming tutorial, so please keep an eye on <a href=\"https://gamemaker.io/en/tutorials\" target=\"_blank\">our tutorials website</a> for more information</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Misc Other Changes To Be Aware Of</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Opera Account users who have never logged-in on the website would see an unhelpful \"UID not present\" error message in previous releases - this is now the correct \"Please complete your profile\" message</li>",
      "\t<li>Opera Account login now has a proper error message when a timeout has happened, letting you know you simply need to try again</li>",
      "\t<li>Opera Account users would receive an unhelpful message in older GM versions when accidentally attempting to login by typing in their old username and password details - this message has now been improved to say your old details no longer work, now you have converted your account, and to simply use the Opera sign-in button instead</li>",
      "\t<li>The micro web server is now always stopped when the main IDE is closed, which stops a number of issues (such as “GameMaker is already running” when trying to install an update), but please be aware of this if you’re testing your games after closing GM itself</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Bugs Fixed</h3>",
      "<ul>  ",
      "\t<li>AnimCurve Editor: GM no longer goes unstable after deleting all curve content then closing and reopening the editor</li>",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: ALT+I to create a new included file resource works again, after being broken in 2022.8</li>",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: Duplicating a sound now correctly renames its new source audio file also, stops an error when later running the project [note that if you have an audio asset already in this state you might need to rename its source file manually one time]</li>",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: GM no longer crashes when attempting \"Add Existing\" for an asset which has a cyclic dependency in its original project</li>",
      "\t<li>Bookmarks: Bookmarks on a line of code now remember if they should reopen as a floating editor in the workspace, rather than always opening as a new code editor workspace tab on their own</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Mac IDE] [HTML5] Fixed being unable to build projects that contain a Spine sprite</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [macOS] Fixed being unable to build a project from the Windows IDE if it is larger than 2GB</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Xbox GDK YYC] Long path names can still require subst in the Visual Studio/GDK tools, so subst has been re-enabled for this target</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Xbox GDK] Explorer is now opened to the correct location when a build succeeds, rather than an unexpected subfolder</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Macro definitions which contain pre-increment operations no longer return a compile error</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Fixed that some 2022.8 projects failed to build/clean due to \"Value cannot be null. (Parameter 'key')\" asset compiler error in GMRoom</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Fixed that Supura… no longer builds in recent versions due to SWF files which worked in older GM versions now being marked as incompatible</li>",

      "\t<li>Code Editor: Hovering over \"Add new event\" and then \"Single Pane\" no longer immediately closes the context menu</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Fixed an issue where pre-2022.8 project layouts containing open code editors expanded all folded code and lost the ability to code fold until the code editor was closed and reopened manually</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: skeleton_skin_create() is now highlighted as an in-built function (Feather or Syntax Errors - both had the issue in 2022.8 and both are fixed now)</li>",
      "\t<li>Crash Reporter: GMWebServer.exe is not ended properly when closing the IDE, appears to sometimes incorrectly trigger the crash reporter [see the note higher up]</li>",
      "\t<li>Debugger: [Mac IDE] Fullscreen IDEs opening windowed debuggers restored from a layout file are now sized correctly (no longer results in a fullscreen debugger window with black bars to fill the gaps)</li>",
      "\t<li>Device Manager: [Mac IDE] \"Detect Browsers\" now detects the full application name for Opera GX correctly, so that browser can now be used as a target device when doing HTML5 builds</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: [Mac IDE] Now shows messages for all Objects correctly, rather than requiring each Object to be opened first before you were informed of its values</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: ArgumentIdentity variables passed to functions now promote their types correctly from the parameter type</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: array_create() return type is now correctly treated as Real, rather than always incorrectly treated as Any</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Code in the format \"var a=1, b=a+1;\" no longer results in an error that \"a\" was treated as out of scope when \"b\" tried to use it</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Creation of new assets or renaming existing assets now reparses the entire project correctly, fixes issues in previous releases with it missing new or old errors</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Now alerts correctly when two functions with the same name are in a script/event (as this is a compile fail and you will need to fix your code)</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Errors in timeline scripts no longer show a red cross image in the Feather Messages \"Resource\" column</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Can now open Timeline assets mentioned in the Feather Messages window by double-clicking them</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Unexpected GM1028 messages are no longer incorrectly raised in some circumstances</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: If an enum has the same name as an asset in the Asset Browser, the tooltip for the enum is now shown correctly (rather than always showing the asset's details, like previous releases did)</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Inner and outer scope hinting no longer breaks when names are reused</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Refactoring operations no longer mangles parentheses of function signatures and new expressions in some circumstances</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Rename identifier & Go To Issue now works correctly even when the Inspector is open</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Renaming a function now correctly refactors the function definition line as well, rather than only renaming all the uses of that function elsewhere in your code</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that Rename Identifier did not work for globalvar, static vars, assets, enums or enum members</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that Rename Identifier also did not work properly inside Object event code editors</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that it was possible for GM to hang after the Rename Identifier window closes</li>",

      "\t<li>Project Saving: [Windows IDE] A dialog is now shown to you whenever GameMaker is unable to rename an asset because its file path on disk is too long [in previous releases this was only written to the ui.log, so you had to open that to see why the rename didn’t work]</li>",

    "version": "2022.5.0.8",
    "release_notes": [
      "<h3>.NET 6 Core Support and New Build Pipeline</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>We have changed pretty much everything on our end as to how we make GameMaker installers and also the runtimes you use (more on the runtimes a bit further down...)</li>",
      "    \t<li>This involves the use of .NET 6 to build the installer and IDE, meaning we have <i>in almost all instances</i> done away with things like the 260-character file path limit on Windows and the use of the subst tool is now pretty much limited to when building for Android</li>",
      "    \t<li>We have also moved to a new build system in order to get even more rapid turnaround on our new versions and confirming bug fixes, etc., also to support the future LTS versions talked about on our recent 2022 update video</li>",
      "    \t<li>NOTE: As part of this massive update to all of our toolchain, you cannot use runtimes from these new versions with older IDEs / older runtimes with these newer IDEs - you must be using a current runtime with the current IDE, otherwise you will see your builds get stuck with the timer carrying on endlessly and in your ui.log you will simply be told “your runtime tools are missing or corrupt”</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>\"Windblown Particle\" Effect Layer Type</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>As we will showcase in our forthcoming new \"Windy Woods\" platformer Template, you can now choose a sprite and control the settings to be used for a wind-blown rain/snow/leaves type Effect in the Room Editor</li>",
      "\t<li>Add a new Filter/Effect layer into the Layers panel and then you will find the new effect type at the bottom of the drop-down list</li>",
      "\t<li>Note that as it says in the Effect dropdown list, \"Effects\" differ from \"Filters\" in that you currently cannot preview an Effect in the Room Editor and you will have to run your game to see it - although, this will be changed in a future release</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Alternate DNS Server Support When Checking The Runtimes Feed</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>Some users have had issues for a while where for whatever reason their system DNS would either not give them the runtime feed properly or it might use a cached copy for a lot longer than expected</li>",
      "    \t<li>If this applies to you, then you can now set an alternative DNS server IP address in Preferences > Runtime Feeds and this will then be used instead of your system's default</li>",
      "    \t<li>You can then go onto the “Master” feed’s own page and click the refresh button to hopefully see the list update immediately</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Sound Inspector Support</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>Allows you to set all the values in the usual editor, plus introduces the ability to see the waveform of your sound (so now you can spot unwanted silence in your sounds, etc.)</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Additions For Go To (Ctrl+T)</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>Added a new option to search all of Preferences, but ignoring all Redefine Keys matches, so that the matches you are shown are only the ones you wanted</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Added New Feather Functionality In The Beta Releases</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>For more information on getting the Beta version and trying out Feather, etc., please see <a href=\"https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018353352\" target=\"_blank\">our guide to GM Beta releases</a></li>",
      "<li>\"Find All References\" is now added via F3 when you have your cursor on a word in the Code Editor - you can step through matches by pressing F3 again or there is a little window in the top-right of the workspace to further control this and show the number of matches (Shift+F3 will also list all matches in the Output Window)</li>",
      "    \t<li>\"// feather\" directive controls can now disable GM1100 errors and also allow you to apply the directive to a whole folder of scripts</li>",
      "    \t<li>The “@context” scoping decoration now also has “@self” added as an alias, as some users expected this name</li>",
      "<li>Similarly “@ignore” can also now be used to achieve the same as “@disable” has done in previous releases</li>",
      "<li>There are also a large number of other bug fixes, which are listed below for informational purposes but only apply if you’re using a Beta version</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Misc Important Changes To Be Aware Of</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: [macOS] Added a proper warning/error for when your project fails to build due to missing provisioning profiles on the Mac, which should make it more obvious what you need to do to fix the issue</li>",
      "    \t<li>Game Options: Completely removed the Amazon Fire section - it has been redundant/legacy information for quite a while, as Amazon Fire target was removed, and so we have now removed the ability to see that content inside the IDE</li>",
      "    \t<li>Game Options: XDK/Xbox One's \"Program ID\" field now support general text, rather than only GUIDs - which is compliant with current submission requirements, but does mean you need to always check the values you’re using here, as the field will no longer detect formatting errors</li>",
      "    \t<li>General: GM could hang when there was a massive burst of debug logging output from a game, so there is now a cap on the maximum amount of logging which will be output each IDE tick - this will stop any hangs, but for games which log huge amounts of information you may see a slight delay before the logging appears</li>",
      "    \t<li>Generate Project Images: Generates a PS4 icon in the correct new format for current SDK versions - you might need to modify your existing icon images so they are compliant</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Other Bugs Fixed</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>AnimCurve Editor: Some labels were not localised and always used English, now they will use your chosen IDE language</li>",
      "    \t<li>Asset Browser: [Create Asset Window] Toggling between List/Grid view did not reliably affect future instances of the window, but now the setting will persist</li>",
      "    \t<li>Asset Browser: Fixed that GM could crash when duplicating any sprite asset if the project happened to contain a script asset called specifically \"Sprites\"</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Android] Cleaning your cache will (correctly) fail to delete cache folders if they are locked externally, but the Output Window log would still say the whole clean process was a \"success\" - now, it will catch that a folder couldn’t be cleaned and let you know accordingly</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Android YYC] Fixed that builds would fail if that project contained any variable which is set to a value greater than max signed Int</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: [iOS] Fixed that building a project which has a display name with an & symbol will fail</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: [OperaGX YYC] Now applies the Game Name value to the browser tab correctly</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: [OperaGX YYC] Fixed that if your project name contains a hyphen, then it would not run</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: [macOS] You are now able to stop projects running remotely on a Mac when using the Windows IDE</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: Fixed an Asset Compiler crash when handling corrupted sprites, such as \"sGrass\" in the project sent to us</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: [Mac IDE] Create Exe now/again opens the final output folder after creating a .dmg, rather than the temp folder it opened in the last release</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: [Ubuntu] GM will now unpack the AppImage before launching the game, which stops issues with extensions</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: Fixed an issue where some projects fail to run from the Steam IDE when using the alternative launcher, and so you might have just seen an empty cmd window</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor: network_send_raw() no longer says all 4 arguments are mandatory and gives a syntax error, now it knows the last one is optional</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor: Fixed a redundant error from being shown when using asset IDs as arguments in inherited constructors</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor: Fixed that using Ctrl+X on the first line would incorrectly remove everything but the last line</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor: Status bar helper text now only highlights the current argument you’re editing, not all of the arguments to the left as well</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor: [Light Skin] Status bar errors have been given more contrast between the black text and the dark red highlight</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor: Shaders now colour the whole words for #else and #endif</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor (Visual): Increasing DPI settings in Preferences no longer causes some node icons to glitch</li>",
      "    \t<li>Debugger: Fixed an issue where you could rapidly/accidentally launch the debugger button twice in a row and this could prevent clicks from being detected in Windows</li>",
      "    \t<li>Docs Integration: Opening the manual will now always default to opening the English copy if the current Preferences language does not actually have a manual (yet), rather than picking some unexpected other language</li>",
      "\t<li>Docs Integration: Fixed that only the English manual is available to select in all 500 Betas and specifically 2022.3.0.625</li>",
      "\t<li>Docs Integration: IT/JP/PO/KR now open their own translated manual when using online versions, rather than always opening English</li>",
      "    \t<li>Extension Editor: [FR] The translated version of \"Uncompress on build\" now fits in the space available</li>",
      "    \t<li>Feather: Skipping an argument in a function call now falls back to the types you originally defined</li>",
      "    \t<li>Feather: GM no longer goes unstable when accessing a struct in a global variable using dot notation and autocomplete</li>",
      "    \t<li>Feather: Auto-complete suggestions are now shown for variables inside functions when using globalvar</li>",

      "\t<li>Project Load: Mac IDE users see too many restrictions on where projects can be kept in 2022.5 (e.g., on the desktop)</li>",
      "\t<li>Project Save: Changes made after to a code editor which was already open in the project layout will not save correctly immediately after updating to 2022.5.0.8</li>",

      "<h3>.NET 6 Core Support and New Build Pipeline</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>We have changed pretty much everything on our end as to how we make GameMaker installers and also the runtimes you use (more on the runtimes a bit further down...)</li>",
      "    \t<li>This involves the use of .NET 6 to build the installer and IDE, meaning we have <i>in almost all instances</i> done away with things like the 260-character file path limit on Windows and the use of the subst tool is now pretty much limited to when building for Android</li>",
      "    \t<li>We have also moved to a new build system in order to get even more rapid turnaround on our new versions and confirming bug fixes, etc., also to support the future LTS versions talked about on our recent 2022 update video</li>",
      "    \t<li>NOTE: As part of this massive update to all of our toolchain, you cannot use runtimes from these new versions with older IDEs / older runtimes with these newer IDEs - you must be using a current runtime with the current IDE, otherwise you will see your builds get stuck with the timer carrying on endlessly and in your ui.log you will simply be told “your runtime tools are missing or corrupt”</li>",

      "<h3>\"Windblown Particle\" Effect Layer Type</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>As we will showcase in our forthcoming new \"Windy Woods\" platformer Template, you can now choose a sprite and control the settings to be used for a wind-blown rain/snow/leaves type Effect in the Room Editor</li>",
      "\t<li>Add a new Filter/Effect layer into the Layers panel and then you will find the new effect type at the bottom of the drop-down list</li>",
      "\t<li>Note that as it says in the Effect dropdown list, \"Effects\" differ from \"Filters\" in that you currently cannot preview an Effect in the Room Editor and you will have to run your game to see it - although, this will be changed in a future release</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Alternate DNS Server Support When Checking The Runtimes Feed</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>Some users have had issues for a while where for whatever reason their system DNS would either not give them the runtime feed properly or it might use a cached copy for a lot longer than expected</li>",
      "    \t<li>If this applies to you, then you can now set an alternative DNS server IP address in Preferences > Runtime Feeds and this will then be used instead of your system's default</li>",
      "    \t<li>You can then go onto the “Master” feed’s own page and click the refresh button to hopefully see the list update immediately</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Sound Inspector Support</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>Allows you to set all the values in the usual editor, plus introduces the ability to see the waveform of your sound (so now you can spot unwanted silence in your sounds, etc.)</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Additions For Go To (Ctrl+T)</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>Added a new option to search all of Preferences, but ignoring all Redefine Keys matches, so that the matches you are shown are only the ones you wanted</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Added New Feather Functionality In The Beta Releases</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>For more information on getting the Beta version and trying out Feather, etc., please see <a href=\"https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018353352\" target=\"_blank\">our guide to GM Beta releases</a></li>",
      "<li>\"Find All References\" is now added via F3 when you have your cursor on a word in the Code Editor - you can step through matches by pressing F3 again or there is a little window in the top-right of the workspace to further control this and show the number of matches (Shift+F3 will also list all matches in the Output Window)</li>",
      "    \t<li>\"// feather\" directive controls can now disable GM1100 errors and also allow you to apply the directive to a whole folder of scripts</li>",
      "    \t<li>The “@context” scoping decoration now also has “@self” added as an alias, as some users expected this name</li>",
      "<li>Similarly “@ignore” can also now be used to achieve the same as “@disable” has done in previous releases</li>",
      "<li>There are also a large number of other bug fixes, which are listed below for informational purposes but only apply if you’re using a Beta version</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Misc Important Changes To Be Aware Of</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: [macOS] Added a proper warning/error for when your project fails to build due to missing provisioning profiles on the Mac, which should make it more obvious what you need to do to fix the issue</li>",
      "    \t<li>Game Options: Completely removed the Amazon Fire section - it has been redundant/legacy information for quite a while, as Amazon Fire target was removed, and so we have now removed the ability to see that content inside the IDE</li>",
      "    \t<li>Game Options: XDK/Xbox One's \"Program ID\" field now support general text, rather than only GUIDs - which is compliant with current submission requirements, but does mean you need to always check the values you’re using here, as the field will no longer detect formatting errors</li>",
      "    \t<li>General: GM could hang when there was a massive burst of debug logging output from a game, so there is now a cap on the maximum amount of logging which will be output each IDE tick - this will stop any hangs, but for games which log huge amounts of information you may see a slight delay before the logging appears</li>",
      "    \t<li>Generate Project Images: Generates a PS4 icon in the correct new format for current SDK versions - you might need to modify your existing icon images so they are compliant</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Other Bugs Fixed</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>AnimCurve Editor: Some labels were not localised and always used English, now they will use your chosen IDE language</li>",
      "    \t<li>Asset Browser: [Create Asset Window] Toggling between List/Grid view did not reliably affect future instances of the window, but now the setting will persist</li>",
      "    \t<li>Asset Browser: Fixed that GM could crash when duplicating any sprite asset if the project happened to contain a script asset called specifically \"Sprites\"</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Android] Cleaning your cache will (correctly) fail to delete cache folders if they are locked externally, but the Output Window log would still say the whole clean process was a \"success\" - now, it will catch that a folder couldn’t be cleaned and let you know accordingly</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Android YYC] Fixed that builds would fail if that project contained any variable which is set to a value greater than max signed Int</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: [iOS] Fixed that building a project which has a display name with an & symbol will fail</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: [OperaGX YYC] Now applies the Game Name value to the browser tab correctly</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: [OperaGX YYC] Fixed that if your project name contains a hyphen, then it would not run</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: [macOS] You are now able to stop projects running remotely on a Mac when using the Windows IDE</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: Fixed an Asset Compiler crash when handling corrupted sprites, such as \"sGrass\" in the project sent to us</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: [Mac IDE] Create Exe now/again opens the final output folder after creating a .dmg, rather than the temp folder it opened in the last release</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: [Ubuntu] GM will now unpack the AppImage before launching the game, which stops issues with extensions</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: Fixed an issue where some projects fail to run from the Steam IDE when using the alternative launcher, and so you might have just seen an empty cmd window</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor: network_send_raw() no longer says all 4 arguments are mandatory and gives a syntax error, now it knows the last one is optional</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor: Fixed a redundant error from being shown when using asset IDs as arguments in inherited constructors</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor: Fixed that using Ctrl+X on the first line would incorrectly remove everything but the last line</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor: Status bar helper text now only highlights the current argument you’re editing, not all of the arguments to the left as well</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor: [Light Skin] Status bar errors have been given more contrast between the black text and the dark red highlight</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor: Shaders now colour the whole words for #else and #endif</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor (Visual): Increasing DPI settings in Preferences no longer causes some node icons to glitch</li>",
      "    \t<li>Debugger: Fixed an issue where you could rapidly/accidentally launch the debugger button twice in a row and this could prevent clicks from being detected in Windows</li>",
      "    \t<li>Docs Integration: Opening the manual will now always default to opening the English copy if the current Preferences language does not actually have a manual (yet), rather than picking some unexpected other language</li>",
      "\t<li>Docs Integration: Fixed that only the English manual is available to select in all 500 Betas and specifically 2022.3.0.625</li>",
      "\t<li>Docs Integration: IT/JP/PO/KR now open their own translated manual when using online versions, rather than always opening English</li>",
      "    \t<li>Extension Editor: [FR] The translated version of \"Uncompress on build\" now fits in the space available</li>",
      "    \t<li>Feather: Skipping an argument in a function call now falls back to the types you originally defined</li>",
      "    \t<li>Feather: GM no longer goes unstable when accessing a struct in a global variable using dot notation and autocomplete</li>",
      "    \t<li>Feather: Auto-complete suggestions are now shown for variables inside functions when using globalvar</li>",

      "<h3>.NET 6 Core Support and New Build Pipeline</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>We have changed pretty much everything on our end as to how we make GameMaker installers and also the runtimes you use (more on the runtimes a bit further down...)</li>",
      "    \t<li>This involves the use of .NET 6 to build the installer and IDE, meaning we have <i>in almost all instances</i> done away with things like the 260-character file path limit on Windows and the use of the subst tool is now pretty much limited to when building for Android</li>",
      "    \t<li>We have also moved to a new build system in order to get even more rapid turnaround on our new versions and confirming bug fixes, etc., also to support the future LTS versions talked about on our recent 2022 update video</li>",
      "    \t<li>NOTE: As part of this massive update to all of our toolchain, you cannot use runtimes from these new versions with older IDEs / older runtimes with these newer IDEs - you must be using a current runtime with the current IDE, otherwise you will see your builds get stuck with the timer carrying on endlessly and in your ui.log you will simply be told “your runtime tools are missing or corrupt”</li>",

      "<h3>\"Windblown Particle\" Effect Layer Type</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>As we will showcase in our forthcoming new \"Windy Woods\" platformer Template, you can now choose a sprite and control the settings to be used for a wind-blown rain/snow/leaves type Effect in the Room Editor</li>",
      "\t<li>Add a new Filter/Effect layer into the Layers panel and then you will find the new effect type at the bottom of the drop-down list</li>",
      "\t<li>Note that as it says in the Effect dropdown list, \"Effects\" differ from \"Filters\" in that you currently cannot preview an Effect in the Room Editor and you will have to run your game to see it - although, this will be changed in a future release</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Alternate DNS Server Support When Checking The Runtimes Feed</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>Some users have had issues for a while where for whatever reason their system DNS would either not give them the runtime feed properly or it might use a cached copy for a lot longer than expected</li>",
      "    \t<li>If this applies to you, then you can now set an alternative DNS server IP address in Preferences > Runtime Feeds and this will then be used instead of your system's default</li>",
      "    \t<li>You can then go onto the “Master” feed’s own page and click the refresh button to hopefully see the list update immediately</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Sound Inspector Support</h3>",
      "<ul>",

      "<h3>Additions For Go To (Ctrl+T)</h3>",
      "<ul>",

      "<li>\"Find All References\" is now added via F3 when you have your cursor on a word in the Code Editor - you can step through matches by pressing F3 again or there is a little window in the top-right of the workspace to further control this and show the number of matches (Shift+F3 will also list all matches in the Output Window)</li>",
      "    \t<li>\"// feather\" directive controls can now disable GM1100 errors and also allow you to apply the directive to a whole folder of scripts</li>",
      "    \t<li>The “@context” scoping decoration now also has “@self” added as an alias, as some users expected this name</li>",
      "<li>Similarly “@ignore” can also now be used to achieve the same as “@disable” has done in previous releases</li>",
      "<li>There are also a large number of other bug fixes, which are listed below for informational purposes but only apply if you’re using a Beta version</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Misc Important Changes To Be Aware Of</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: [macOS] Added a proper warning/error for when your project fails to build due to missing provisioning profiles on the Mac, which should make it more obvious what you need to do to fix the issue</li>",
      "    \t<li>Game Options: Completely removed the Amazon Fire section - it has been redundant/legacy information for quite a while, as Amazon Fire target was removed, and so we have now removed the ability to see that content inside the IDE</li>",
      "    \t<li>Game Options: XDK/Xbox One's \"Program ID\" field now support general text, rather than only GUIDs - which is compliant with current submission requirements, but does mean you need to always check the values you’re using here, as the field will no longer detect formatting errors</li>",
      "    \t<li>General: GM could hang when there was a massive burst of debug logging output from a game, so there is now a cap on the maximum amount of logging which will be output each IDE tick - this will stop any hangs, but for games which log huge amounts of information you may see a slight delay before the logging appears</li>",
      "    \t<li>Generate Project Images: Generates a PS4 icon in the correct new format for current SDK versions - you might need to modify your existing icon images so they are compliant</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Other Bugs Fixed</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>AnimCurve Editor: Some labels were not localised and always used English, now they will use your chosen IDE language</li>",

      "    \t<li>Asset Browser: Fixed that GM could crash when duplicating any sprite asset if the project happened to contain a script asset called specifically \"Sprites\"</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Android] Cleaning your cache will (correctly) fail to delete cache folders if they are locked externally, but the Output Window log would still say the whole clean process was a \"success\" - now, it will catch that a folder couldn’t be cleaned and let you know accordingly</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Android YYC] Fixed that builds would fail if that project contained any variable which is set to a value greater than max signed Int</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: [iOS] Fixed that building a project which has a display name with an & symbol will fail</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: [OperaGX YYC] Now applies the Game Name value to the browser tab correctly</li>",

      "    \t<li>Building Projects: Fixed an Asset Compiler crash when handling corrupted sprites, such as \"sGrass\" in the project sent to us</li>",

      "    \t<li>Building Projects: [Ubuntu] GM will now unpack the AppImage before launching the game, which stops issues with extensions</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: Fixed an issue where some projects fail to run from the Steam IDE when using the alternative launcher, and so you might have just seen an empty cmd window</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor: network_send_raw() no longer says all 4 arguments are mandatory and gives a syntax error, now it knows the last one is optional</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor: Fixed a redundant error from being shown when using asset IDs as arguments in inherited constructors</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor: Fixed that using Ctrl+X on the first line would incorrectly remove everything but the last line</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor: Status bar helper text now only highlights the current argument you’re editing, not all of the arguments to the left as well</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor: [Light Skin] Status bar errors have been given more contrast between the black text and the dark red highlight</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor: Shaders now colour the whole words for #else and #endif</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor (Visual): Increasing DPI settings in Preferences no longer causes some node icons to glitch</li>",
      "    \t<li>Debugger: Fixed an issue where you could rapidly/accidentally launch the debugger button twice in a row and this could prevent clicks from being detected in Windows</li>",
      "    \t<li>Docs Integration: Opening the manual will now always default to opening the English copy if the current Preferences language does not actually have a manual (yet), rather than picking some unexpected other language</li>",
      "\t<li>Docs Integration: Fixed that only the English manual is available to select in all 500 Betas and specifically 2022.3.0.625</li>",
      "\t<li>Docs Integration: IT/JP/PO/KR now open their own translated manual when using online versions, rather than always opening English</li>",
      "    \t<li>Extension Editor: [FR] The translated version of \"Uncompress on build\" now fits in the space available</li>",
      "    \t<li>Feather: Skipping an argument in a function call now falls back to the types you originally defined</li>",
      "    \t<li>Feather: GM no longer goes unstable when accessing a struct in a global variable using dot notation and autocomplete</li>",
      "    \t<li>Feather: Auto-complete suggestions are now shown for variables inside functions when using globalvar</li>",
      "    \t<li>Feather: Fixed an error when accessing the \"self\" struct via accessor</li>",
      "    \t<li>Feather: Fixed that enums were previously considered as structs</li>",

      "\t<li>Feather: Hovering over globalvar variables now shows a tooltip</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Variables declared outside of variable method are no longer marked as undefined in the method</li>",

      "    <li>If you want to use Feather, please enable it in your Preferences</li>",
      "    <li>Also fixed a number of Syntax Errors issues which have been in Betas since Feather was introduced - so now if you do turn Feather off, the “old” errors are more reliable and the dialog populates itself automatically whenever you open it</li>",

      "<h3>Additions To Feather</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    <li>Feather now supports basic type narrowing using \"object_index\", \"typeof\", \"instanceof\", and the built-in \"is_\" functions. E.g. if (is_string(a) && typeof(b) == \"number\")</li>",
      "    <li>Changed Feather's tooltips to combine different tooltips into the one, so overlapping tooltips no longer occur for autocomplete, JSDoc content, and rules</li>",
      "    <li>Also changed Feather's tooltips to limit the number of struct fields if there are too many to show at once (and added a Preference for saying how many is \"too many\" for you)</li>",
      "    <li>Implemented that autocomplete highlights/prioritises in-scope variables at the top of the suggestion list</li>",
      "    <li>Fixed some performance issues also - in particular, significant improvements to \"Analysing Project...\" times when opening projects</li>",
      "    <li>The following types have been renamed: “Resource” is now “Asset”, “Mixed” is now “Any”, and  “ArgumentIdentity” is now “Any*”. Element Types are also now shown inside trailing angle brackets</li>",
      "    <li>Please see the full changelist lower down, as there are a lot more to be aware of!</li>",

      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Additional Control For Extensions</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    <li>Added a new system called Extension Options, which allows you to declare new fields in a dedicated new “Options” window in the Extension Editor</li>",
      "    <li>These new fields then appear to everyone using your extension on the main window of the Extension Editor, so they can be filled in very much like Instance Variables in the Object Editor</li>",
      "\t<li>In this way, people using your extension can set their in-game values inside the Extension Editor and their values are then saved per-Configuration, etc., by GameMaker</li>",
      "    <li>Added the ability to exclude extension functions from appearing in the Code Editor auto-complete pop-up</li>",
      "    <li>[Android] Implemented the ability to inject into gradle.properties</li>",

      "    <li>Opera GX's Game Options have been modified to make selecting which game is to be updated much easier, as GameMaker will now automatically retrieve information from the GX website - however, if you have previously uploaded any games, then you will likely need to check these values are set correctly in those projects before attempting to do your next builds, otherwise you might get a “Bad Data” error when uploading</li>",
      "    <li>Android YYC - The runner is now built using NDK 24, so we would recommend that you use this NDK version for all builds (NDK 24 is supported by earlier GM releases and indeed is already our recommended NDK on the setup FAQ, so you may be using this anyway)</li>",
      "    <li>PS5 SDK support updated to version 5.00 - you will need to change your SDK installation and GameMaker Preferences to match</li>",
      "    <li>PS4 SDK support updated to version 9.50 - you will need to change your SDK installation and GameMaker Preferences to match</li>",
      "    <li>Xbox GDK support updated to the \"March 2022\" version - you will need to change your SDK installation and GameMaker Preferences to match</li>",

      "    <li>Feather: Fixed what looked like a hang when parsing chained function calls larger than 6 calls [it was actually that it just took a long time to process the function chain - it’s now much faster and so you shouldn’t see any “stalls”]</li>",
      "    <li>Feather: Autocomplete window now appears when typing in the Visual editor or Inspector</li>",

      "    <li>Android YYC - The runner is now built using NDK 24, so we would recommend that you use this NDK version for all builds (NDK 24 is supported by earlier GM releases and indeed is already our recommended NDK on the setup FAQ, so you may be using this anyway)</li>",

      "<h3>Removed Some Legacy Platforms/Architectures</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Some lesser-used or largely redundant versions of the targets have now been removed, so we can focus support on the current tools instead. These are:</li>",
      "\t<li>Android x86 32bit architecture (x86_64 is still there, so you can still use 64bit emulators)</li>",
      "\t<li>UWP target has been removed entirely, as the Windows store has accepted native packages for a while and the GDK extension can be used to implement current versions of Microsoft’s social functionality</li>",
      "\t<li>Windows x86 (32bit support) architecture has been removed from Game Options, so now only 64bit executables are available</li>",
      "\t<li>Xbox One Legacy (XDK) target has been removed entirely, as GDK has been available for a while</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Resource Refactor And Project Saving Changes</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>This release introduces a big clean-up to how assets are handled, which should have very minor impact on how you work, but will make future releases far more stable</li>",
      "\t<li>Fixed a very important project-saving bug where if a script's source file had become locked (e.g., by an external process such as source control or Dropbox/GDrive/OneDrive, etc.) and therefore wasn't able to be read, then it was possible that Feather would incorrectly cause some <i>other</i> assets to be lost (typically Scripts, but not limited to this)</li>",
      "\t<li>Project loading will now also merge duplicate folders whenever they are detected in a .yyp file - so if you had a project which for some reason had gained duplicate folders in the Asset Browser, you should now find that simply opening the project in this version will clean that up (if you know that you have a project in this state it’s worth creating a backup before you open it, so that if you do have any issues you can send us the original version for investigation)</li>",
      "\t<li>Creating a new event in the Object Editor will now trigger an immediate save of your project, as this fixes multiple issues with source control status, but also when discarding other unsaved changes on closing GameMaker</li>",
      "\t<li>Case-insensitive file names are back - please be aware of this if you are moving projects between OS installations which use different naming conventions (or when committing into Git source-control repos)</li>",
      "\t<li>Fixed some memory management around loading assets, which will stop potential leaks and also fixes an issue with breakpoints failing to stay on the correct line in Object events if you later add other lines higher up in your code</li>",
      "\t<li>For each of the above points there may be minor changes to the file formatting/contents of some resources, so please be aware of this the next time you're committing to source control and if you see some unexpected changes</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Project Format Changes For Tile Layers In Rooms</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>We have introduced a new, much faster method for storing tile data in your rooms and passing this information into your builds - games which are using tile maps extensively in their designs may see a reduction in the size on disk of their projects, as well as a reduced load time</li>",
      "\t<li>This change also fixes a long-time compiler issue where projects containing rooms with lots of tile slots could see a pause on the line \"Found Project Format 2\" in their output log</li>",
      "\t<li>However, this new format is not compatible with older IDEs/runtimes and so accordingly we have introduced a new safeguard in this version, should you attempt to open a project in an older IDE again.</li>",
      "\t<li>On opening the project in any version newer than 2022.6 GameMaker will raise the project version automatically to be 1.6</li>",
      "\t<li>The next time a room containing a tile layer is edited in the newer IDE, this will potentially upgrade all the tile data and save it in a \"TileCompressedData'' variable in the room’s own .yyp file - at this point, this project cannot be loaded into previous IDEs as it won’t understand its tile layer information. (Any game built by the 2022.8 or later IDEs, but using a runtime from 2022.6 or older will also lack all this tile layer’s content, so please be careful using older runtimes.)</li>",
      "\t<li>Please note if the room wouldn't benefit from the compression, GameMaker will continue to store the data in the old-style \"TileSerialiseData\" variable - this is the same format as before and previous IDEs can open it if you need to; however, you will need to follow the steps in <a href=\"https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/4518066618129#h_01G8BB59TF9493M47YTAZX15CZ\" target=\"_blank\">our FAQ for opening “too new” projects in older IDEs</a></li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>More Effect Layer Types</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>New filters have been added for Contrast, Fractal Noise, Gradient, Colour LUT (\"Look-Up Table\"), and Twist Blur</li>",
      "\t<li>See the manual for more info and give them a try in the room editor to determine if they would be a good fit for your projects</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Additional Rollback Multiplayer Functionality And Visual Editor Fixes</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>New functions and a new Rollback event have been added for providing chat functionality to your players</li>",
      "\t<li>New Visual nodes have been added for the above, plus we added an optional “layer” field onto the Rollback Define Player node</li>",
      "\t<li>Toolbox icons have been also updated to the proper images for all the existing rollback nodes</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Added Opera GX Game Options SSO Account Label</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>In previous releases there was no indication/error given if a game registration failed because you were actually logged-in as a different SSO account in your browser to the one you had logged-into GM with</li>",
      "\t<li>Now, Game Options always tells you which account GameMaker will use to register/upload your games to (or if you're not actually logged-in yet), so you can more easily see when there is an upload fail due to a simple account mismatch</li>\t",
      "\t<li>Note: if you do happen to use multiple Opera accounts, then you should continue to make sure your web browser is signed-in to the one you need before doing any uploads</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Feather Functionality/Fixes</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Naming Rules now have a new value of \"Unconstrained\", which you can set to tell Feather to allow any naming convention when dealing with certain aspects of your code</li>",
      "\t<li>Added a new Preference for whether you want relaxed or strict type-checking (previous versions were “strict”, 2022.8 defaults to “relaxed” now)</li>",
      "\t<li>Also added a new Preference for controlling the amount of warnings Feather will show you in the code editor. You can now select between varying levels in the dropdown, which progressively enable more of the current warnings: \"None\" (which is compile errors only), \"Syntax Errors\" (which is syntax errors and compile errors),\"Type Errors\" (which adds variable type enforcement warnings), and \"All\" (everything Feather offers)</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather now does its parsing work on a separate application thread, so projects will load more quickly and should no longer cause \"stalls\"/\"freezes\" as you edit your projects or when renaming any scripts which contain functions referenced in multiple places elsewhere in your code - this last scenario will also no longer trigger an unwanted File Watcher dialog</li>",
      "\t<li>Fixed very poor general/overall IDE performance when thousands of Lint Messages are discovered</li>",
      "\t<li>Fixed some general performance issues with parsing scripts that contain a lot of JSDoc comments</li>",
      "\t<li>Syntax highlighting for tooltips now matches the colours/styling of the code editor</li>",
      "\t<li>You should also now find documents are fully code-coloured much more quickly after opening</li>",
      "\t<li>Added an option to prefer multi-line or single-line JSDoc style during generation</i>",
      "\t<li>Added support for sorting by Code/Message/Resource column values into the Messages window</li>",
      "\t<li>There are also a lot of other Feather fixes lower down in the release notes, so please do review them also</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Additional Extension Options Functionality</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Added combobox gadget support into the extension options editor and also the ability to mark settings as hidden to the “user-facing” options panel on the main Extension Editor window</li>",
      "\t<li>Added support for native-language Android and iOS extensions to access extension options values</li>",
      "\t<li>Added a button for reverting each “user value” on the main Extension Editor window to the default values provided on the Extension Options window</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Misc Important Changes To Be Aware Of</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>As you may have noticed already, the New Version popup now contains a \"Don't ask me again\" option - this will hide the popup until the <i>next</i> version is released</li>",
      "\t<li>Sound assets with invalid or non-existent underlying files were previously still included in game builds, but this of course would cause issues in-game if you tried modifying them later, so now you will be asked to fix all problem sounds before the build will succeed - again, to be clear, those sounds would not have worked correctly in-game in previous releases and our only change here is that you were not told this</li>",
      "\t<li>Similar to the above, the Room Editor “Stripes Background”,  \"Vignette\" and “LUT Colour Grading” filters will all now warn you during builds if your chosen sprite has not been marked in the Sprite Editor as being on a texture page by itself, and will expect you to fix this also - again, to be clear, this setting not being ticked caused various issues when drawing the filters in-game in previous releases, so now we are simply better communicating that the checkbox always needed to be set</li>",
      "\t<li>Added support for Android's \"ProGuard\" minifying and shrinking options, both of which can be used to reduce your game’s output package size and therefore the amount of data new players need to download when installing your game. You can now enable these settings in Game Options if you wish (they both default to off) and the corresponding steps will then be performed during your builds. Note that you cannot enable \"shrinkResources\" without also having \"minifyEnabled\" enabled, as the Android tools do not allow that (minify on its own is allowed). We also added $YYAndroidProguard as a tag so that your extensions can inject into the proguard.pro file.</li>",
      "\t<li>Made a fix where GM could crash when adding multiple files at once to the Included Files “Datafiles” directory outside GameMaker, but please note that the fix for this one means <i>empty</i> folders will no longer be shown in the Included Files editor window - they are still on disk just fine, but they won’t appear until you actually add some files into them</li>",
      "\t<li>Fixed that duplicating a layer in the Room Editor did not preserve all of its instances’ creation code on the new layer you made and so you had to copy the code manually later - now, all the code is copied for you, as you would expect</li>",
      "\t<li>The font used for Chinese in the Mac IDE has now been subtly changed, as the one we used is no longer included by Apple in recent macOS versions and so this could cause a number of issues when trying to draw font characters in various places within GameMaker</li>",
      "\t<li>When building projects, all .zip output packages have been changed to be encoded as UTF-8, which stops issues when non-ASCII characters have been typed in Included Files folder names (files inside that folder would then fail to be found in-game)</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Other Bugs Fixed</h3>",
      "<ul>  ",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: You are now able to delete multiple Tags at once in Quick Access</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Compiler should now be much faster and no longer stay on \"Found Project Format 2\" lines in the Output Windows for any projects containing lots of tile slots in rooms [see the tile-encoding change mentioned higher up]</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Fixed an issue where converting SWF files could fail with \"Attempted to divide by 0\" when trying to build project SaveNew...</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: No longer creates an empty Pre-Create event/file for any objects that don't actually need them [saves filesize and also in-game memory]</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Extension Options values are now expanded correctly before Android/iOS/tvOS code-injection</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Game Options > Windows values are now passed into NSIS builds correctly, so .exes will show the correct copyright, etc. information in Windows’ properties dialogs</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Removed all \"hobby licence\" functionality and splash screens from the runtimes</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Sound assets with invalid or non-existent underlying files are no longer embedded in the game, will error instead [see the longer explanation higher up]</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Switch builds again contain the IDE version number in their metadata (only 2022.6 lacked this)</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Texture pages are no longer rewritten every run, causing long build times (they were in 2022.6)</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Android] Deploying to an emulator at the end of a build when using recent Android SDK versions no longer results in a \"no device connected\" error</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Android] Projects are now able to clean their cache successfully whenever any path names are > 260 chars</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [HTML5] Global-scope macros which call in-built variables no longer cause a build error</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [HTML5] index.html is no longer included twice in the output package if a custom .html has been selected in Game Options</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Mac IDE] Building archives for iOS and tvOS now automatically opens Xcode Organiser when the build has succeeded</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Mac IDE] HTML5 and Android targets now automatically opens Finder when the build has succeeded</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [macOS] Fixed an issue where some special characters (such as apostrophes and brackets) were not escaped properly and so caused builds to fail</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Mac IDE] macOS YYC builds will no longer incorrectly claim a success <i>for the run part</i> when targeting a different CPU architecture to the local machine [the build itself should work fine, but as you’re using the wrong CPU it’s correct that the run part will always fail to launch the game]</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [OperaGX] Now correctly disables the Create Exe button immediately after starting a build, stops it being possible to have multiple builds/uploads running (which could also cause GM crash if too many started at once)</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Ubuntu YYC] The appimage is now correctly unpacked when the game is run from the IDE, which stops extensions failing to find files</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Ubuntu] Now able to build projects successfully when targeting a 22.04 LTS machine, as the \"Permission denied (publickey)\" 22.04 gave has now been fixed [20.04 LTS remains our suggested dev platform for now anyway]</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Windows] Fixed that builds could fail with a \"startIndex cannot be larger than length of string\" error if Windows is set to certain non-English language and region formatting styles combinations</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Xbox GDK] Added a new Preference for whether to always deploy the package after doing a Create Exe</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Xbox GDK] Fixed that cancelling a build manually did not always immediately re-enable the Create Exe button</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [YYC] Fixed that builds failed when defining a new function and giving it args for its parent constructor and a \"new\" constructor for a related child</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [YYC] Fixed that builds failed when struct member names are strings containing spaces</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [tvOS] Fixed that builds which trigger the \"Persistent Storage\" dialog would continue to fill your ui.log with silent and redundant errors until GM is next closed by you</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Fixed that calling <i>gml_pragma(\"PNGCrush\");</i> did nothing in the recent GM versions since we re-introduced PNG outputs</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (Visual): Fixed that the node for \"If Key Pressed (Rollback)\" converted to Code didn't do anything, because it never had code beyond creating and setting a temp variable to hold the key input state</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (Visual): Rollback node icons no longer all use the one \"dice\" image [see the Rollback section higher up for more]</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (Visual): Typing \"x\" and \"y\" in an instance's creation code editor will no longer also modify its Flip X/Y values in the room</li>",
      "\t<li>Note that there were actual several ways in which Room Editor commands could be accidentally triggered when typing in GML Visual editors which were open over the top of the room, and the fix above should resolve all of them</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (Visual): Using arrow keys whilst typing a comment incorrectly no longer switches the focus to a different node, will instead just move the caret as you would expect</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Footer no longer shows red after updating to a new GM version if a code editor was already open in your 2022.3 project layout</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Rollback variables \"player_id\" and \"player_local\" are now coloured as built-in variables</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Tab names now have the correct letter casing, rather than always only lowercase letters</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: [Windows IDE] Win+V dialog now pastes successfully from the clipboard</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: network_send_raw(), skeleton_animation_set() and skeleton_animation_set_ext() all now correctly have their final argument marked as optional in autocomplete</li>",
      "\t<li>Config Editor: No longer possible to open multiple editors at once, which could lead to incorrect values being saved in previous releases</li>",
      "\t<li>Debugger: Now displays the actual instance IDs and object type rather than raw references which were harder to understand what they meant</li>",
      "\t<li>Debugger: GM no longer hangs when debugging instance_create_layer() due to new \"ref\" type in 2022.6 / Debugger: GM no longer hangs when debugging projects which attempt to work with the new \"ref\" type in 2022.6</li>",
      "\t<li>Debugger: Originating code is now shown correctly when hitting a breakpoint located on a line which has } at the end</li>",
      "\t<li>Debugger: Fixed that sometimes the play button was not re-enabled after hitting a breakpoint</li>",
      "\t<li>Debugger: [Mac IDE] Maximised windows restored from a layout file are now correctly sized as soon as they appear (so no longer have to animate as it resizes to fix)</li>",
      "\t<li>Device Manager: [Mac IDE] Ubuntu hostname values are now automatically trimmed of any accidental whitespace at either end of the string, which stops \"Hostname not valid\" error when testing the connection to your newly-added device</li>",
      "\t<li>Device Manager: [Mac IDE] \"Launch Simulator\" for iOS and tvOS now launch the correct matching simulator every time, rather just asking Xcode to launch the last simulator used and therefore possibly being the wrong one for the platform being built that time</li>",
      "\t<li>Device Manager: [Switch] Fixed that \"Test Connection\" for a blank hostname always claimed it was successful because GameMaker attempted a check for USB-only EDEVs, but that check itself also required a fix - now, it the field is blank <i>and</i> no EDEV can be found on a USB port, then you get be the expected fail result</li>",

      "\t<li>Go To: Fixed that GM could crash when using the search assets functionality if the expected results failed to appear and so you repeatedly reopened Go To and performed the search again in an attempt to refresh the list [Note that you will now get a warning message if GM thinks there are any missing results - please send us your ui.log, the project itself, and a mention of what your search term was in a bug report if you see this new warning]</li>",

      "\t<li>Preferences: Fixed that if you were using the Chinese language option for IDE Language, then certain fonts (such as JetBrains) use a substitute font for their Chinese glyphs, but that other font was not refreshed when the “parent” font was selected, which resulted in missing characters inside various parts of GameMaker</li>",

      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>This release introduces a big clean-up to how assets are handled, which should have very minor impact on how you work, but will make future releases far more stable</li>",
      "\t<li>Fixed a very important project-saving bug where if a script's source file had become locked (e.g., by an external process such as source control or Dropbox/GDrive/OneDrive, etc.) and therefore wasn't able to be read, then it was possible that Feather would incorrectly cause some <i>other</i> assets to be lost (typically Scripts, but not limited to this)</li>",

      "\t<li>Case-insensitive file names are back - please be aware of this if you are moving projects between OS installations which use different naming conventions (or when committing into Git source-control repos)</li>",
      "\t<li>Fixed some memory management around loading assets, which will stop potential leaks and also fixes an issue with breakpoints failing to stay on the correct line in Object events if you later add other lines higher up in your code</li>",
      "\t<li>For each of the above points there may be minor changes to the file formatting/contents of some resources, so please be aware of this the next time you're committing to source control and if you see some unexpected changes</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Project Format Changes For Tile Layers In Rooms</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>We have introduced a new, much faster method for storing tile data in your rooms and passing this information into your builds - games which are using tile maps extensively in their designs may see a reduction in the size on disk of their projects, as well as a reduced load time</li>",
      "\t<li>This change also fixes a long-time compiler issue where projects containing rooms with lots of tile slots could see a pause on the line \"Found Project Format 2\" in their output log</li>",
      "\t<li>However, this new format is not compatible with older IDEs/runtimes and so accordingly we have introduced a new safeguard in this version, should you attempt to open a project in an older IDE again.</li>",
      "\t<li>On opening the project in any version newer than 2022.6 GameMaker will raise the project version automatically to be 1.6</li>",
      "\t<li>The next time a room containing a tile layer is edited in the newer IDE, this will potentially upgrade all the tile data and save it in a \"TileCompressedData'' variable in the room’s own .yyp file - at this point, this project cannot be loaded into previous IDEs as it won’t understand its tile layer information. (Any game built by the 2022.8 or later IDEs, but using a runtime from 2022.6 or older will also lack all this tile layer’s content, so please be careful using older runtimes.)</li>",
      "\t<li>Please note if the room wouldn't benefit from the compression, GameMaker will continue to store the data in the old-style \"TileSerialiseData\" variable - this is the same format as before and previous IDEs can open it if you need to; however, you will need to follow the steps in <a href=\"https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/4518066618129#h_01G8BB59TF9493M47YTAZX15CZ\" target=\"_blank\">our FAQ for opening “too new” projects in older IDEs</a></li>",

      "<h3>More Effect Layer Types</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>New filters have been added for Contrast, Fractal Noise, Gradient, Colour LUT (\"Look-Up Table\"), and Twist Blur</li>",
      "\t<li>See the manual for more info and give them a try in the room editor to determine if they would be a good fit for your projects</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Additional Rollback Multiplayer Functionality And Visual Editor Fixes</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>New functions and a new Rollback event have been added for providing chat functionality to your players</li>",
      "\t<li>New Visual nodes have been added for the above, plus we added an optional “layer” field onto the Rollback Define Player node</li>",
      "\t<li>Toolbox icons have been also updated to the proper images for all the existing rollback nodes</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Added Opera GX Game Options SSO Account Label</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>In previous releases there was no indication/error given if a game registration failed because you were actually logged-in as a different SSO account in your browser to the one you had logged-into GM with</li>",
      "\t<li>Now, Game Options always tells you which account GameMaker will use to register/upload your games to (or if you're not actually logged-in yet), so you can more easily see when there is an upload fail due to a simple account mismatch</li>\t",
      "\t<li>Note: if you do happen to use multiple Opera accounts, then you should continue to make sure your web browser is signed-in to the one you need before doing any uploads</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Feather Functionality/Fixes</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Naming Rules now have a new value of \"Unconstrained\", which you can set to tell Feather to allow any naming convention when dealing with certain aspects of your code</li>",
      "\t<li>Added a new Preference for whether you want relaxed or strict type-checking (previous versions were “strict”, 2022.8 defaults to “relaxed” now)</li>",
      "\t<li>Also added a new Preference for controlling the amount of warnings Feather will show you in the code editor. You can now select between varying levels in the dropdown, which progressively enable more of the current warnings: \"None\" (which is compile errors only), \"Syntax Errors\" (which is syntax errors and compile errors),\"Type Errors\" (which adds variable type enforcement warnings), and \"All\" (everything Feather offers)</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather now does its parsing work on a separate application thread, so projects will load more quickly and should no longer cause \"stalls\"/\"freezes\" as you edit your projects or when renaming any scripts which contain functions referenced in multiple places elsewhere in your code - this last scenario will also no longer trigger an unwanted File Watcher dialog</li>",
      "\t<li>Fixed very poor general/overall IDE performance when thousands of Lint Messages are discovered</li>",
      "\t<li>Fixed some general performance issues with parsing scripts that contain a lot of JSDoc comments</li>",
      "\t<li>Syntax highlighting for tooltips now matches the colours/styling of the code editor</li>",
      "\t<li>You should also now find documents are fully code-coloured much more quickly after opening</li>",
      "\t<li>Added an option to prefer multi-line or single-line JSDoc style during generation</i>",
      "\t<li>Added support for sorting by Code/Message/Resource column values into the Messages window</li>",
      "\t<li>There are also a lot of other Feather fixes lower down in the release notes, so please do review them also</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Additional Extension Options Functionality</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Added combobox gadget support into the extension options editor and also the ability to mark settings as hidden to the “user-facing” options panel on the main Extension Editor window</li>",
      "\t<li>Added support for native-language Android and iOS extensions to access extension options values</li>",
      "\t<li>Added a button for reverting each “user value” on the main Extension Editor window to the default values provided on the Extension Options window</li>",

      "<h3>Misc Important Changes To Be Aware Of</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>As you may have noticed already, the New Version popup now contains a \"Don't ask me again\" option - this will hide the popup until the <i>next</i> version is released</li>",
      "\t<li>Sound assets with invalid or non-existent underlying files were previously still included in game builds, but this of course would cause issues in-game if you tried modifying them later, so now you will be asked to fix all problem sounds before the build will succeed - again, to be clear, those sounds would not have worked correctly in-game in previous releases and our only change here is that you were not told this</li>",
      "\t<li>Similar to the above, the Room Editor “Stripes Background”,  \"Vignette\" and “LUT Colour Grading” filters will all now warn you during builds if your chosen sprite has not been marked in the Sprite Editor as being on a texture page by itself, and will expect you to fix this also - again, to be clear, this setting not being ticked caused various issues when drawing the filters in-game in previous releases, so now we are simply better communicating that the checkbox always needed to be set</li>",
      "\t<li>Added support for Android's \"ProGuard\" minifying and shrinking options, both of which can be used to reduce your game’s output package size and therefore the amount of data new players need to download when installing your game. You can now enable these settings in Game Options if you wish (they both default to off) and the corresponding steps will then be performed during your builds. Note that you cannot enable \"shrinkResources\" without also having \"minifyEnabled\" enabled, as the Android tools do not allow that (minify on its own is allowed). We also added $YYAndroidProguard as a tag so that your extensions can inject into the proguard.pro file.</li>",
      "\t<li>Made a fix where GM could crash when adding multiple files at once to the Included Files “Datafiles” directory outside GameMaker, but please note that the fix for this one means <i>empty</i> folders will no longer be shown in the Included Files editor window - they are still on disk just fine, but they won’t appear until you actually add some files into them</li>",
      "\t<li>Fixed that duplicating a layer in the Room Editor did not preserve all of its instances’ creation code on the new layer you made and so you had to copy the code manually later - now, all the code is copied for you, as you would expect</li>",
      "\t<li>The font used for Chinese in the Mac IDE has now been subtly changed, as the one we used is no longer included by Apple in recent macOS versions and so this could cause a number of issues when trying to draw font characters in various places within GameMaker</li>",
      "\t<li>When building projects, all .zip output packages have been changed to be encoded as UTF-8, which stops issues when non-ASCII characters have been typed in Included Files folder names (files inside that folder would then fail to be found in-game)</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Other Bugs Fixed</h3>",
      "<ul>  ",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: You are now able to delete multiple Tags at once in Quick Access</li>",

      "\t<li>Building Projects: Fixed an issue where converting SWF files could fail with \"Attempted to divide by 0\" when trying to build project SaveNew...</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: No longer creates an empty Pre-Create event/file for any objects that don't actually need them [saves filesize and also in-game memory]</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Extension Options values are now expanded correctly before Android/iOS/tvOS code-injection</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Game Options > Windows values are now passed into NSIS builds correctly, so .exes will show the correct copyright, etc. information in Windows’ properties dialogs</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Removed all \"hobby licence\" functionality and splash screens from the runtimes</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Sound assets with invalid or non-existent underlying files are no longer embedded in the game, will error instead [see the longer explanation higher up]</li>",

      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Mac IDE] HTML5 and Android targets now automatically opens Finder when the build has succeeded</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [macOS] Fixed an issue where some special characters (such as apostrophes and brackets) were not escaped properly and so caused builds to fail</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Mac IDE] macOS YYC builds will no longer incorrectly claim a success <i>for the run part</i> when targeting a different CPU architecture to the local machine [the build itself should work fine, but as you’re using the wrong CPU it’s correct that the run part will always fail to launch the game]</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [OperaGX] Now correctly disables the Create Exe button immediately after starting a build, stops it being possible to have multiple builds/uploads running (which could also cause GM crash if too many started at once)</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Ubuntu YYC] The appimage is now correctly unpacked when the game is run from the IDE, which stops extensions failing to find files</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Ubuntu] Now able to build projects successfully when targeting a 22.04 LTS machine, as the \"Permission denied (publickey)\" 22.04 gave has now been fixed [20.04 LTS remains our suggested dev platform for now anyway]</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Windows] Fixed that builds could fail with a \"startIndex cannot be larger than length of string\" error if Windows is set to certain non-English language and region formatting styles combinations</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Xbox GDK] Added a new Preference for whether to always deploy the package after doing a Create Exe</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Xbox GDK] Fixed that cancelling a build manually did not always immediately re-enable the Create Exe button</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [YYC] Fixed that builds failed when defining a new function and giving it args for its parent constructor and a \"new\" constructor for a related child</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [YYC] Fixed that builds failed when struct member names are strings containing spaces</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [tvOS] Fixed that builds which trigger the \"Persistent Storage\" dialog would continue to fill your ui.log with silent and redundant errors until GM is next closed by you</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Fixed that calling <i>gml_pragma(\"PNGCrush\");</i> did nothing in the recent GM versions since we re-introduced PNG outputs</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (Visual): Fixed that the node for \"If Key Pressed (Rollback)\" converted to Code didn't do anything, because it never had code beyond creating and setting a temp variable to hold the key input state</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (Visual): Rollback node icons no longer all use the one \"dice\" image [see the Rollback section higher up for more]</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (Visual): Typing \"x\" and \"y\" in an instance's creation code editor will no longer also modify its Flip X/Y values in the room</li>",
      "\t<li>Note that there were actual several ways in which Room Editor commands could be accidentally triggered when typing in GML Visual editors which were open over the top of the room, and the fix above should resolve all of them</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (Visual): Using arrow keys whilst typing a comment incorrectly no longer switches the focus to a different node, will instead just move the caret as you would expect</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Footer no longer shows red after updating to a new GM version if a code editor was already open in your 2022.3 project layout</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Rollback variables \"player_id\" and \"player_local\" are now coloured as built-in variables</li>",

      "\t<li>Code Editor: network_send_raw(), skeleton_animation_set() and skeleton_animation_set_ext() all now correctly have their final argument marked as optional in autocomplete</li>",
      "\t<li>Config Editor: No longer possible to open multiple editors at once, which could lead to incorrect values being saved in previous releases</li>",
      "\t<li>Debugger: Now displays the actual instance IDs and object type rather than raw references which were harder to understand what they meant</li>",
      "\t<li>Debugger: GM no longer hangs when debugging instance_create_layer() due to new \"ref\" type in 2022.6 / Debugger: GM no longer hangs when debugging projects which attempt to work with the new \"ref\" type in 2022.6</li>",

      "\t<li>Device Manager: [Mac IDE] Ubuntu hostname values are now automatically trimmed of any accidental whitespace at either end of the string, which stops \"Hostname not valid\" error when testing the connection to your newly-added device</li>",
      "\t<li>Device Manager: [Mac IDE] \"Launch Simulator\" for iOS and tvOS now launch the correct matching simulator every time, rather just asking Xcode to launch the last simulator used and therefore possibly being the wrong one for the platform being built that time</li>",
      "\t<li>Device Manager: [Switch] Fixed that \"Test Connection\" for a blank hostname always claimed it was successful because GameMaker attempted a check for USB-only EDEVs, but that check itself also required a fix - now, it the field is blank <i>and</i> no EDEV can be found on a USB port, then you get be the expected fail result</li>",
      "\t<li>Docs Integration: F1/MMB on a function name again opens the correct page (rather than just opening the manual's home page as it did in 2022.6.1)</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: \"delete\" now correctly flags GM1052 when called on constructor functions created by \"new\", which helps prevent unexpected in-game code errors</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: \"id\" in-built variable is no longer treated as read-only when assigned-to inside structs (e.g. \"self.id = 1;\"), which lead to incorrect GM1008 and GM1052 errors being raised in previous versions</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: \"player_id\" and all other rollback multiplayer variables no longer cause unexpected Error GM1013 messages</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: \"with\" loops can now recognise arbitrary expressions</li>",

      "\t<li>Feather: Anonymous functions declared in another function's parameter initialisation are now found correctly whenever referenced elsewhere in your code</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Autocomplete is now much better at showing all matching results when typing a partial word if that term also comes after a special character in the result name (e.g., \"lis\" in \"ds_list_create\" would not work in previous releases) - note, however, that Feather is cleverer than the old Syntax Errors and so may legitimately/deliberately not show you as many results, but this is because it has ignored unwanted matches</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Autocompletion windows no longer disappear/flicker when typing long identifiers near the end of a file</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Comparing \"shader_current\" to -1 is now correctly allowed</li>",

      "\t<li>Feather: GM no longer goes unstable when typing a dot after the square brackets of an array</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that GM1059 being raised against a function declaration line also blocked the parsing of that function's body, which stopped you from seeing other errors/warnings in that code</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: GM1061 (\"index might be out of range\") has now be removed as it was found to frequently give false-positives, which stopped it being useful in many situations</li>",

      "\t<li>Feather: Helper popups should now never cover the line of code the caret is on</li>",

      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that the Messages panel highlight/selection could become offset from the mouse cursor when scrolling through lots of messages</li>",

      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that valid syntax in the format <i>new (function () constructor { ... })()</i> or <i>new array[i]()</i> were both incorrectly marked as an error</li>",

      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that pre-increment operators following a semicolon were incorrectly parsed as if \";++\"</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed various issues with using Quick Fix to perform JSDoc generation: mangling of pre-existing comment style; missing out tabs/spaces; omitting preceding and trailing comments or whitespace; omitting pre-existing @ignore, @deprecated, and @context attributes; mangling union types; that it occasionally resulted in unexpected \"function not found\" errors; and that it was not available for anonymous functions assigned to variables or struct literal members</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that JSDoc generation also did not correctly reparse all affected scripts after a change</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Removed JSDoc generation support for a global-scope script’s return statement, as this is deprecated functionality (if you want this, instead declare a function inside that script)</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that Quick Fix occasionally did nothing when you asked it to work on static variable declarations</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that performing multiple Quick Fixes in a row followed by one Undo via control/command+z would undo all/several of those Quick Fixes rather than only the last one</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that Quick Fix suggestions did not appear inside function bodies</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that reassigning a macro to be an anonymous function created by \"new\" resulted in type-inference breaking</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that recommended names for assets did not always match the custom values set in Preferences for casing if a default prefix/suffix was set also [now, whatever you type in will always be used in the suggestion - regardless of whether or not your text matches the casing rule you selected]</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that rendering tooltips of enums with a lot of members did not fit into the IDE window - now only shows a maximum number at once</li>",

      "\t<li>GXC Integration: Game uploads no longer fail if the Game Options \"Game Name\" value contains an underscore or certain other special characters (however, there are still some character rules your names must follow, so you will now also get a message whenever your desired game name is not compliant)</li>",

      "\t<li>Go To: Fixed that GM could crash when using the search assets functionality if the expected results failed to appear and so you repeatedly reopened Go To and performed the search again in an attempt to refresh the list [Note that you will now get a warning message if GM thinks there are any missing results - please send us your ui.log, the project itself, and a mention of what your search term was in a bug report if you see this new warning]</li>",

      "<h3>Opera Account Settings Migration</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>In previous releases, if you used one email address for your GameMaker account and a different email for your Opera Account and you have already converted your GameMaker account to be an Opera account on our website, then this would cause your Preferences and Recent Projects, etc., to be “lost”, because GameMaker is now looking in a new folder for them</li>",
      "\t<li>This version will rename the original folder for you and avoid you having to “migrate” your settings manually; however, it will only do this if you have not converted already - if you have already converted your account and so this issue applies to you, please see <a href=\"https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/6893026074525\" target=\"_blank\">our FAQ for how to quickly and easily recover your settings</a></li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Changes To The Default Project Layout</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>The default project layout now includes the Inspector as a new left-hand dock (but of course it is freely movable and dockable) and no longer includes Recent Windows as a panel inside the right-hand dock</li>",
      "\t<li>Though the Inspector has been around for a long time already, we are now bringing it to the front and making it more relevant inside other editors</li>",
      "\t<li>Please note that any existing layouts in your projects are of course unaffected by this change, and so if you want to see the changes you can use Layout -> Reset Layout menubar option. (If you have a highly customised layout you use in your projects you may also want to use Save Layout and ensure you backup your current layout.)</li>",
      "\t<li>Recent Windows can still be opened from the Windows menubar entry and added to your project layout again if you wish</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Changes To How GameMaker Loads/Saves Game Options</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Up until now, GameMaker always treated the licence of the last person to open a project as <i>the definitive list of game options that project requires</i> - so if one team member has a lot of targets on their licence all of them would be configured and if the project was then shared with a new team member who only had Test, a lot of those options would be removed again</li>",
      "\t<li>Now, your options will “merge” - so if you have team members who have different licence types, the Game Options values will remain in the project and cover everyone’s licences</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>New Room Inspector And Changes To The Room Editor Layout</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>The new Room Inspector is how you will now access many of the settings for rooms</li>",
      "\t<li>Before, all of a room’s settings and its layers were cramped into a single panel; now, all of the settings are handled as part of the Inspector and the Layers panel is a dockable panel which can be detached and placed where you want</li>",
      "\t<li>The Inspector UI is also more dynamic/responsive and only shows certain functionality if it’s relevant (e.g., Inheritance settings are only shown in the Inspector if you are in a child room, rather than always being shown in the old Room Editor layout)</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>”Opera GX” Target Rebranded As “GX.games”</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>The target has always been part of a whole ecosystem of releasing your games on the GX.games site and sharing them with others (for free or as paid content), so this new name clarifies that</li>",
      "\t<li>If you have not had a look at <a href=\"https://gx.games\" target=\"_blank\">GX.games</a> and what it offers, please do check it out and play a few games, see if it’s a route you would like to take also</li>",
      "\t<li>You already have access to publish games on it (for free) as part of your Opera Account and you can also see <a href=\"https://gamemaker.io/en/tutorials/publish-to-gxgames-tutorial\" target=\"_blank\">our tutorial about what publishing on GX.games involves</a> if you want more info</li>",
      "\t<li>Also added a new \"os_gxgames\" constant (which duplicates the existing \"os_operagx\", so you do not need to change existing code) in order to be consistent in-game with this branding change</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>New Options For Texture Group Management</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>You will now find the texture groups editor has new controls for whether you want to split textures off into their own data files on disk during your builds, as this can be required by bigger games on some platforms which have memory caps on how much data you can have loaded at any moment (e.g., GX.games only allows 2GB)</li>",
      "\t<li>You can then use the matching 2022.9 runtimes to load/unload these groups in-game as you require</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>New Visual Node “Add Motion”</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>This new function takes a direction and speed and modifies the in-built hspeed and vspeed values accordingly - so you have the one node to manage, but can change several values at once behind-the-scenes (the node performs the following code: <i>hspeed += speed * dcos(direction); vspeed += speed * -dsin(direction);</i>)</li>",
      "\t<li>The new node will be part of an upcoming tutorial, so please keep an eye on <a href=\"https://gamemaker.io/en/tutorials\" target=\"_blank\">our tutorials website</a> for more information</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Misc Other Changes To Be Aware Of</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Opera Account users who have never logged-in on the website would see an unhelpful \"UID not present\" error message in previous releases - this is now the correct \"Please complete your profile\" message</li>",
      "\t<li>Opera Account login now has a proper error message when a timeout has happened, letting you know you simply need to try again</li>",
      "\t<li>Opera Account users would receive an unhelpful message in older GM versions when accidentally attempting to login by typing in their old username and password details - this message has now been improved to say your old details no longer work, now you have converted your account, and to simply use the Opera sign-in button instead</li>",
      "\t<li>The micro web server is now always stopped when the main IDE is closed, which stops a number of issues (such as “GameMaker is already running” when trying to install an update), but please be aware of this if you’re testing your games after closing GM itself</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Bugs Fixed</h3>",
      "<ul>  ",
      "\t<li>AnimCurve Editor: GM no longer goes unstable after deleting all curve content then closing and reopening the editor</li>",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: ALT+I to create a new included file resource works again, after being broken in 2022.8</li>",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: Duplicating a sound now correctly renames its new source audio file also, stops an error when later running the project [note that if you have an audio asset already in this state you might need to rename its source file manually one time]</li>",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: GM no longer crashes when attempting \"Add Existing\" for an asset which has a cyclic dependency in its original project</li>",
      "\t<li>Bookmarks: Bookmarks on a line of code now remember if they should reopen as a floating editor in the workspace, rather than always opening as a new code editor workspace tab on their own</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Mac IDE] [HTML5] Fixed being unable to build projects that contain a Spine sprite</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [macOS] Fixed being unable to build a project from the Windows IDE if it is larger than 2GB</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Xbox GDK YYC] Long path names can still require subst in the Visual Studio/GDK tools, so subst has been re-enabled for this target</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Xbox GDK] Explorer is now opened to the correct location when a build succeeds, rather than an unexpected subfolder</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Macro definitions which contain pre-increment operations no longer return a compile error</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Fixed that some 2022.8 projects failed to build/clean due to \"Value cannot be null. (Parameter 'key')\" asset compiler error in GMRoom</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Fixed that Supura… no longer builds in recent versions due to SWF files which worked in older GM versions now being marked as incompatible</li>",

      "\t<li>Code Editor: skeleton_skin_create() is now highlighted as an in-built function (Feather or Syntax Errors - both had the issue in 2022.8 and both are fixed now)</li>",
      "\t<li>Crash Reporter: GMWebServer.exe is not ended properly when closing the IDE, appears to sometimes incorrectly trigger the crash reporter [see the note higher up]</li>",
      "\t<li>Debugger: [Mac IDE] Fullscreen IDEs opening windowed debuggers restored from a layout file are now sized correctly (no longer results in a fullscreen debugger window with black bars to fill the gaps)</li>",
      "\t<li>Device Manager: [Mac IDE] \"Detect Browsers\" now detects the full application name for Opera GX correctly, so that browser can now be used as a target device when doing HTML5 builds</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: [Mac IDE] Now shows messages for all Objects correctly, rather than requiring each Object to be opened first before you were informed of its values</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: ArgumentIdentity variables passed to functions now promote their types correctly from the parameter type</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: array_create() return type is now correctly treated as Real, rather than always incorrectly treated as Any</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Code in the format \"var a=1, b=a+1;\" no longer results in an error that \"a\" was treated as out of scope when \"b\" tried to use it</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Creation of new assets or renaming existing assets now reparses the entire project correctly, fixes issues in previous releases with it missing new or old errors</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Now alerts correctly when two functions with the same name are in a script/event (as this is a compile fail and you will need to fix your code)</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Errors in timeline scripts no longer show a red cross image in the Feather Messages \"Resource\" column</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Can now open Timeline assets mentioned in the Feather Messages window by double-clicking them</li>",

      "\t<li>Feather: If an enum has the same name as an asset in the Asset Browser, the tooltip for the enum is now shown correctly (rather than always showing the asset's details, like previous releases did)</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Inner and outer scope hinting no longer breaks when names are reused</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Refactoring operations no longer mangles parentheses of function signatures and new expressions in some circumstances</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Rename identifier & Go To Issue now works correctly even when the Inspector is open</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Renaming a function now correctly refactors the function definition line as well, rather than only renaming all the uses of that function elsewhere in your code</li>",

      "\t<li>Project Saving: [Windows IDE] A dialog is now shown to you whenever GameMaker is unable to rename an asset because its file path on disk is too long [in previous releases this was only written to the ui.log, so you had to open that to see why the rename didn’t work]</li>",

      "<h3>New Runtime Modules Dialog For Customising Your Runtime Downloads</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>You will see a new dialog for this the first time you start this new version, so for more information on this dialog and how to use it, please see <a href=\"https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/7303279382173\" target=\"_blank\">our new FAQ all about it</a></li>",
      "\t<li>GameMaker now handles downloading just the specific modules you require from each runtime - you can select a minimal install suitable for your current OS, whichever modules you require just now, or “just give me everything” (which is what GameMaker has always done until now)</li>",
      "\t<li>You can modify these choices at any time by clicking the new button on the Runtime Feeds screen, but be aware that whilst the dialog will add additional modules okay, it will not remove any which were previously downloaded  - if you wanted to do that, you will currently need to modify the dialog settings and then delete your entire runtime folder, so that GameMaker will re-download just the bits you now want</li>",
      "<li>Preferences has also been changed so that downloading any runtime version manually will always ask if you want to activate it, regardless of where on that line you clicked when initiating the download (previously, you had to specifically click the version number in order to be asked)</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Offline Support When Signed-In Using Opera Account</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Up until this release, you were unable to use GameMaker offline if you had migrated your account and signed-in using the Opera Account single sign-in method</li>",
      "\t<li>You now can sign-in to a saved Opera Account session and carry on offline for the usual must-go-online-once-a-month requirement that GameMaker Accounts have long used</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Pinch-To-Zoom Has Been Re-Implemented</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>The Workspace can now be zoomed in and out on devices with touch inputs (like trackpads)</li>",
      "\t<li>Windows IDE, this is done via Ctrl plus one finger on the trackpad; Mac IDE, it’s a two-finger pinch gesture</li>",
      "\t<li>There is a new Preference to disable this feature if you don’t want it</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Image Editor Support For Pasting As A New Layer</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>The Image Editor now allows you to paste directly from your clipboard to a new layer</li>",
      "\t<li>This new layer will be automatically placed above the currently-selected layer and the pan tool will be auto-selected to immediately allow you to control the pasted content as you wish</li>",
      "\t<li>This is the default behaviour now, as there was a lot of feedback in favour of this change, but the previous “Paste-As-Brush” behaviour can be enabled again in Preferences if you want it</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Implemented Case-Insensitive Compatibility Mode For The Mac IDE</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>There has been an ongoing issue with case-sensitivity when working across different operating systems and changing an asset's character case when renaming it (and how this change of case might then effect external tools, such as git)</li>",
      "\t<li>An option has been added to allow you to disable these extra renaming checks, as it is quite performance-heavy</li>",
      "\t<li>(The same changes affect the Ubuntu IDE Beta also, as it behaves the same as the Mac IDE)</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Feather Additions</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Feather Now reparses scripts whenever they are edited outside GameMaker</li>",
      "\t<li>The new rule GM2064 will validate that initialiser struct variables have variable definitions for the target object (and its Quick Fixes will now create Variable Definitions for missing fields)</li>",
      "\t<li>GM1013’s Quick Fix behaviour has now been modified for creating an instance variable</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Device Manager Support For Opera GX Mobile Devices</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>You will likely see a new firewall prompt for this the first time you start this new version, so for more information on this functionality and how to use it, please see <a href=\"https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/7961446360221\" target=\"_blank\">our new FAQ all about it</a></li>",
      "\t<li>Added a new MQTT server for discovering Opera GX Mobile devices on your network, allowing you to just as easily test your GX games on your phone or tablet as you can on your desktop</li>",
      "\t<li>Simply scan the QR code inside Device Manager to connect the mobile device to GameMaker in seconds</li>",
      "\t<li>Note that your devices are only linked to that one instance of GameMaker and will be forgotten the next time you close GameMaker</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>More Room Editor Layers Functionality</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Old Film, Hue, Ripples, Blocks Background, Panorama Background and Parallax Background have all now been added into the Room Editor for you to use in your games</li>",
      "\t<li>Also added an indicator into the Layers Panel to show when any filter/effect has been used on a layer</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Code Editor Support For Binary Literals And Underscores In Numbers</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Binary literals can now be declared in the form 0b…. (same as the hex literal 0x… that GameMaker has supported for a while). For example: <i>var six = 0b0110;</i> or <i>var thirteen = 0b0100 | 0b1001;</i></li>",
      "\t<li>Also, integer, floating point, hex, and binary literals may now take an underscore to act as a visual separator. For example: <i>var integer = 100_000_000;</i> or <i>var float = 3_141.59;</i> or <i>var hexadec = 0xDEAD_BEEF;</i> or <i>var binary = 0b01101000_01101001;</i></li>",
      "\t<li>Note that this is a Code Editor and Compiler change only - there is no support for this in-game</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Misc Other Changes To Be Aware Of</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Gradle version has been updated to match the requirements of Android APIs 32+ [please see the runtime notes for a little more information]</li>",
      "\t<li>Debugger: The struct versions of \"activeTracks\" no longer uses the wrong order for \"colourmultiply\" track values [was actually that the in-game order was wrong and you might need to change your code, so please see the runtime note’s Change To Be Aware Of section for more information on this one]</li>",
      "\t<li>Licensing: Proxy server of incorrect type causes startup crash [additionally, the proxy server details field now blocks https addresses from being added and there is more logging also for if your setup <i>does</i> somehow still cause issues]</li>",
      "\t<li>Localisation: Our language csv files have now been updated to conform to RFC 4180 standard (and therefore escape special characters) - whilst you may not need to make any changes in your existing custom language files, you should be aware of this process change if you’re editing ours or making your own localisation spreadsheets from scratch in future</li>",
      "\t<li>Sequence Editor: It was never really exposed in the IDE, but there was a WIP asset track available in-game - this has now been removed, as the full in-game implementation was never done, and so if you were using this “hidden” track in your games you will now need to change your code accordingly</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Other Bugs Fixed</h3>",
      "<ul> ",
      "\t<li>AnimCurve Editor: [Windows IDE] GM no longer crashes when undoing all changes made to a newly-created curve</li>",

      "\t<li>Building Projects: [HTML5] Builds no longer fail for audio files which contain .png or other non-audio metadata, which also stops a method of GameMaker going unstable when reloading the project after failing that build</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [HTML5] Builds again work reliably when the Game Options’ \"path folder name\" has been changed from the default of \"html5game\" to anything custom [this was an issue in 2022.9 only]</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Ubuntu IDE] iOS YYC projects containing extensions no longer gives an incomplete Xcode project with missing .ext files</li>",

      "\t<li>Code Editor (Visual): In multicolumn layouts, using the arrow keys no longer affects all columns at the same time</li>",

      "\t<li>Debugger: Fixed that HTML5 games could fail to run (gives white screen) if invisible non-standard characters had accidentally been included in the project and therefore broke the obfuscation process</li>",

      "<h3>Project Format Changes For Tile Layers In Rooms</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>We have introduced a new, much faster method for storing tile data in your rooms and passing this information into your builds - which fixes a long-time issue where rooms with lots of tile slots could see a pause on the line \"Found Project Format 2\" in their output log</li>",
      "\t<li>However, this new format is not compatible with older IDEs/runtimes and so accordingly we have introduced a new safeguard in this version, should you attempt to open a project in an older IDE again.</li>",
      "\t<li>On opening the project in any version newer than 2022.6 GameMaker will raise the project version automatically to be 1.6</li>",
      "\t<li>The next time a room containing a tile layer is edited in the newer IDE, this will potentially upgrade all the tile data and save it in a \"TileCompressedData\" variable in the room’s own .yyp file - at this point, this project cannot be loaded into previous IDEs as it won’t understand it. (The project would also lack all the tiles information if you used a current IDE but with a runtime from 2022.6 or older.)</li>",
      "\t<li>Please note if the room wouldn't benefit from the compression, GameMaker will continue to store the data in the old-style \"TileSerialiseData\" variable - this is the same format as before and previous IDEs can open it if you need to; however, you will need to follow the steps in <a href=\"https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/4518066618129#h_01G8BB59TF9493M47YTAZX15CZ\" target=\"_blank\">our FAQ for opening “too new” projects in older IDEs</a></li>",

      "<h3>Additional Feather Functionality</h3>",

      "\t<li>New functions and a rollback event have been added for providing chat functionality to your players</li>",
      "\t<li>New Visual nodes have been added for the above, plus some others which were missing from earlier Betas - and Toolbox icons have been fixed for the existing rollback nodes</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Additional Feather Functionality</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Naming Rules now have a new value of \"Unconstrained\", which you can set to tell Feather to allow any naming convention when dealing with certain aspects of your code</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Additional Extension Options Functionality</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Added combobox gadget support into the extension options editor and also the ability to mark settings as hidden to the “user-facing” extension options</li>",
      "\t<li>Added support for native-language Android/iOS extensions to access your extension options values, as set in the IDE</li> ",

      "\t<li>Also added $YYAndroidProguard as a tag so that your extensions can inject into the proguard.pro file</li>",
      "\t<li>Included Files: GM crashes after adding multiple files at once to Datafiles directory [note that the fix for this one means <i>empty</i> folders wil no longer be shown in the Included Files editor window, but they are still on disk just fine]</li>",

      "\t<li>Building Projects: \"Stripes Background\" filter type will draw parts of other sprites in-game if the one chosen has not been set as on its own texture page [this actually is the same recommendation for several filter types, so now the IDE will warn you if your chosen sprite has not been marked as being on a textuire page by itself]</li>",

(The project would also lack all the tiles information if you used a current IDE but with a runtime from 2022.6 or older.)</li>",

      "\t<li>Now, Game Options tells you which account GameMaker will use to register/upload your games to (or if you're not actually logged-in yet), so you can more easily see when there is an upload fail due to a simple account mismatch</li>\t",

      "<h3>Misc Important Changes To Be Aware Of</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Added support for Android's \"ProGuard\" minifying and shrinking options - you can now enable these in Game Options if you wish (defaults to off) and the corresponding steps will then be performed during your builds </li>\t",
      "\t<li>Also added $YYAndroidProguard as a tag so that your extensions can inject into the proguard.pro file</li>",
      "\t<li>Included Files: GM crashes after adding multiple files at once to Datafiles directory [note that the fix for this one means <i>empty</i> folders wil no longer be shown in the Included Files editor window, but they are still on disk just fine]</li>",

      "\t<li>Building Projects: \"Stripes Background\" filter type will draw parts of other sprites in-game if the one chosen has not been set as on its own texture page [this actually is the same recommendation for several filter types, so now the IDE will warn you if your chosen sprite has not been marked as being on a textuire page by itself]</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Rollback variables \"player_id\" and \"player_local\" are not coloured as built-in variables</li>",

(The project would also lack all the tiles information if you used a current IDE but with a runtime from 2022.6 or older.)</li>",

(The project would also lack all the tiles information if you used a current IDE but with a runtime from 2022.6 or older.)</li>",

      "<h3>Restored Some Missing Fixes</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Project loading will now also merge duplicate folders whenever they are detected in a .yyp file - so if you had a project which for some reason had gained duplicate folders in the Asset Browser, you should now find that simply opening the project in this version will clean that up (if you know that you have a project in this state it’s worth creating a backup before you open it, so that if you do have any issues you can send us the original version for investigation)</li>",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: Moving a folder of assets into another folder will cause resource load failures</li>",
      "\t<li>Project Load: Room Editor background layer colour values are no longer reset to white when loading a project</li>",
      "\t<li>Project Save: GM no longer hangs for some users when renaming a script (stops unexpected File Watcher dialogs also) [a final part of this fix had been lost in 34]</li>",

      "<h2>2022.8.0.34</h2>",
      "<h3>Removed Some Legacy Platforms/Architectures</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Some lesser-used or largely redundant versions of the targets have now been removed, so we can focus support on the current tools instead. These are:</li>",
      "\t<li>Android x86 32bit architecture (x86_64 is still there, so you can still use 64bit emulators)</li>",
      "\t<li>UWP target has been removed entirely, as the Windows store has accepted native packages for a while and the GDK extension can be used to implement current versions of Microsoft’s social functionality</li>",
      "\t<li>Windows x86 (32bit support) architecture has been removed from Game Options, so now only 64bit executables are available</li>",
      "\t<li>Xbox One Legacy (XDK) target has been removed entirely, as GDK has been available for a while</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Resource Refactor And Project Saving Changes</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>This release introduces a big clean-up to how assets are handled, which should have very minor impact on how you work, but will make future releases far more stable</li>",
      "\t<li>Fixed a very important project-saving bug where if a script's source file had become locked (e.g., by an external process such as source control or Dropbox/GDrive/OneDrive, etc.) and therefore wasn't able to be read, then it was possible that Feather would incorrectly cause some <i>other</i> assets to be lost (typically Scripts, but not limited to this)</li>",
      "\t<li>Creating a new event in the Object Editor will now trigger an immediate save of your project, as this fixes multiple issues with source control status, but also when discarding other unsaved changes on closing GameMaker</li>",
      "\t<li>Case-insensitive file names are back - please be aware of this if you are moving projects between OS installations which use different naming conventions (or when committing into Git source-control repos)</li>",
      "\t<li>Fixed some memory management around loading assets, which will stop potential leaks and also fixes an issue with breakpoints failing to stay on the correct line in Object events if you later add other lines higher up in your code</li>",
      "\t<li>For each of the above points there may be minor changes to the file formatting/contents of some resources, so please be aware of this the next time you're committing to source control and if you see some unexpected changes</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Project Format Changes For Tile Layers In Rooms</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>We have introduced a new, much faster method for storing tile data in your rooms and passing this information into your builds - games which are using tile maps extensively in their designs may see a reduction in the size on disk of their projects, as well as a reduced load time</li>",
      "\t<li>This change also fixes a long-time compiler issue where projects containing rooms with lots of tile slots could see a pause on the line \"Found Project Format 2\" in their output log</li>",
      "\t<li>However, this new format is not compatible with older IDEs/runtimes and so accordingly we have introduced a new safeguard in this version, should you attempt to open a project in an older IDE again.</li>",
      "\t<li>On opening the project in any version newer than 2022.6 GameMaker will raise the project version automatically to be 1.6</li>",
      "\t<li>The next time a room containing a tile layer is edited in the newer IDE, this will potentially upgrade all the tile data and save it in a \"TileCompressedData'' variable in the room’s own .yyp file - at this point, this project cannot be loaded into previous IDEs as it won’t understand its tile layer information. (Any game built by the 2022.8 or later IDEs, but using a runtime from 2022.6 or older will also lack all this tile layer’s content, so please be careful using older runtimes.)</li>",
      "\t<li>Please note if the room wouldn't benefit from the compression, GameMaker will continue to store the data in the old-style \"TileSerialiseData\" variable - this is the same format as before and previous IDEs can open it if you need to; however, you will need to follow the steps in <a href=\"https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/4518066618129#h_01G8BB59TF9493M47YTAZX15CZ\" target=\"_blank\">our FAQ for opening “too new” projects in older IDEs</a></li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>More Effect Layer Types</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>New filters have been added for Contrast, Fractal Noise, Gradient, Colour LUT (\"Look-Up Table\"), and Twist Blur</li>",
      "\t<li>See the manual for more info and give them a try in the room editor to determine if they would be a good fit for your projects</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Additional Rollback Multiplayer Functionality And Visual Editor Fixes</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>New functions and a new Rollback event have been added for providing chat functionality to your players</li>",
      "\t<li>New Visual nodes have been added for the above, plus we added an optional “layer” field onto the Rollback Define Player node</li>",
      "\t<li>Toolbox icons have been also updated to the proper images for all the existing rollback nodes</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Added Opera GX Game Options SSO Account Label</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>In previous releases there was no indication/error given if a game registration failed because you were actually logged-in as a different SSO account in your browser to the one you had logged-into GM with</li>",
      "\t<li>Now, Game Options always tells you which account GameMaker will use to register/upload your games to (or if you're not actually logged-in yet), so you can more easily see when there is an upload fail due to a simple account mismatch</li>\t",
      "\t<li>Note: if you do happen to use multiple Opera accounts, then you should continue to make sure your web browser is signed-in to the one you need before doing any uploads</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Feather Functionality/Fixes</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Naming Rules now have a new value of \"Unconstrained\", which you can set to tell Feather to allow any naming convention when dealing with certain aspects of your code</li>",
      "\t<li>Added a new Preference for whether you want relaxed or strict type-checking (previous versions were “strict”, 2022.8 defaults to “relaxed” now)</li>",
      "\t<li>Also added a new Preference for controlling the amount of warnings Feather will show you in the code editor. You can now select between varying levels in the dropdown, which progressively enable more of the current warnings: \"None\" (which is compile errors only), \"Syntax Errors\" (which is syntax errors and compile errors),\"Type Errors\" (which adds variable type enforcement warnings), and \"All\" (everything Feather offers)</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather now does its parsing work on a separate application thread, so projects will load more quickly and should no longer cause \"stalls\"/\"freezes\" as you edit your projects or when renaming any scripts which contain functions referenced in multiple places elsewhere in your code - this last scenario will also no longer trigger an unwanted File Watcher dialog</li>",
      "\t<li>Fixed very poor general/overall IDE performance when thousands of Lint Messages are discovered</li>",
      "\t<li>Fixed some general performance issues with parsing scripts that contain a lot of JSDoc comments</li>",
      "\t<li>Syntax highlighting for tooltips now matches the colours/styling of the code editor</li>",
      "\t<li>You should also now find documents are fully code-coloured much more quickly after opening</li>",
      "\t<li>Added an option to prefer multi-line or single-line JSDoc style during generation</i>",
      "\t<li>Added support for sorting by Code/Message/Resource column values into the Messages window</li>",
      "\t<li>There are also a lot of other Feather fixes lower down in the release notes, so please do review them also</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Additional Extension Options Functionality</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Added combobox gadget support into the extension options editor and also the ability to mark settings as hidden to the “user-facing” options panel on the main Extension Editor window</li>",
      "\t<li>Added support for native-language Android and iOS extensions to access extension options values</li>",
      "\t<li>Added a button for reverting each “user value” on the main Extension Editor window to the default values provided on the Extension Options window</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Misc Important Changes To Be Aware Of</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>As you may have noticed already, the New Version popup now contains a \"Don't ask me again\" option - this will hide the popup until the <i>next</i> version is released</li>",
      "\t<li>Sound assets with invalid or non-existent underlying files were previously still included in game builds, but this of course would cause issues in-game if you tried modifying them later, so now you will be asked to fix all problem sounds before the build will succeed - again, to be clear, those sounds would not have worked correctly in-game in previous releases and our only change here is that you were not told this</li>",
      "\t<li>Similar to the above, the Room Editor “Stripes Background”,  \"Vignette\" and “LUT Colour Grading” filters will all now warn you during builds if your chosen sprite has not been marked in the Sprite Editor as being on a texture page by itself, and will expect you to fix this also - again, to be clear, this setting not being ticked caused various issues when drawing the filters in-game in previous releases, so now we are simply better communicating that the checkbox always needed to be set</li>",
      "\t<li>Added support for Android's \"ProGuard\" minifying and shrinking options, both of which can be used to reduce your game’s output package size and therefore the amount of data new players need to download when installing your game. You can now enable these settings in Game Options if you wish (they both default to off) and the corresponding steps will then be performed during your builds. Note that you cannot enable \"shrinkResources\" without also having \"minifyEnabled\" enabled, as the Android tools do not allow that (minify on its own is allowed). We also added $YYAndroidProguard as a tag so that your extensions can inject into the proguard.pro file.</li>",
      "\t<li>Made a fix where GM could crash when adding multiple files at once to the Included Files “Datafiles” directory outside GameMaker, but please note that the fix for this one means <i>empty</i> folders will no longer be shown in the Included Files editor window - they are still on disk just fine, but they won’t appear until you actually add some files into them</li>",
      "\t<li>Fixed that duplicating a layer in the Room Editor did not preserve all of its instances’ creation code on the new layer you made and so you had to copy the code manually later - now, all the code is copied for you, as you would expect</li>",
      "\t<li>The font used for Chinese in the Mac IDE has now been subtly changed, as the one we used is no longer included by Apple in recent macOS versions and so this could cause a number of issues when trying to draw font characters in various places within GameMaker</li>",
      "\t<li>When building projects, all .zip output packages have been changed to be encoded as UTF-8, which stops issues when non-ASCII characters have been typed in Included Files folder names (files inside that folder would then fail to be found in-game)</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Other Bugs Fixed</h3>",
      "<ul>  ",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: You are now able to delete multiple Tags at once in Quick Access</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Compiler should now be much faster and no longer stay on \"Found Project Format 2\" lines in the Output Windows for any projects containing lots of tile slots in rooms [see the tile-encoding change mentioned higher up]</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Fixed an issue where converting SWF files could fail with \"Attempted to divide by 0\" when trying to build project SaveNew...</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: No longer creates an empty Pre-Create event/file for any objects that don't actually need them [saves filesize and also in-game memory]</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Extension Options values are now expanded correctly before Android/iOS/tvOS code-injection</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Game Options > Windows values are now passed into NSIS builds correctly, so .exes will show the correct copyright, etc. information in Windows’ properties dialogs</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Removed all \"hobby licence\" functionality and splash screens from the runtimes</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Sound assets with invalid or non-existent underlying files are no longer embedded in the game, will error instead [see the longer explanation higher up]</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Switch builds again contain the IDE version number in their metadata (only 2022.6 lacked this)</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Texture pages are no longer rewritten every run, causing long build times (they were in 2022.6)</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Android] Deploying to an emulator at the end of a build when using recent Android SDK versions no longer results in a \"no device connected\" error</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Android] Projects are now able to clean their cache successfully whenever any path names are > 260 chars</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [HTML5] Global-scope macros which call in-built variables no longer cause a build error</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [HTML5] index.html is no longer included twice in the output package if a custom .html has been selected in Game Options</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Mac IDE] Building archives for iOS and tvOS now automatically opens Xcode Organiser when the build has succeeded</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Mac IDE] HTML5 and Android targets now automatically opens Finder when the build has succeeded</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [macOS] Fixed an issue where some special characters (such as apostrophes and brackets) were not escaped properly and so caused builds to fail</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Mac IDE] macOS YYC builds will no longer incorrectly claim a success <i>for the run part</i> when targeting a different CPU architecture to the local machine [the build itself should work fine, but as you’re using the wrong CPU it’s correct that the run part will always fail to launch the game]</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [OperaGX] Now correctly disables the Create Exe button immediately after starting a build, stops it being possible to have multiple builds/uploads running (which could also cause GM crash if too many started at once)</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Ubuntu YYC] The appimage is now correctly unpacked when the game is run from the IDE, which stops extensions failing to find files</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Ubuntu] Now able to build projects successfully when targeting a 22.04 LTS machine, as the \"Permission denied (publickey)\" 22.04 gave has now been fixed [20.04 LTS remains our suggested dev platform for now anyway]</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Windows] Fixed that builds could fail with a \"startIndex cannot be larger than length of string\" error if Windows is set to certain non-English language and region formatting styles combinations</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Xbox GDK] Added a new Preference for whether to always deploy the package after doing a Create Exe</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Xbox GDK] Fixed that cancelling a build manually did not always immediately re-enable the Create Exe button</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [YYC] Fixed that builds failed when defining a new function and giving it args for its parent constructor and a \"new\" constructor for a related child</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [YYC] Fixed that builds failed when struct member names are strings containing spaces</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [tvOS] Fixed that builds which trigger the \"Persistent Storage\" dialog would continue to fill your ui.log with silent and redundant errors until GM is next closed by you</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Fixed that calling <i>gml_pragma(\"PNGCrush\");</i> did nothing in the recent GM versions since we re-introduced PNG outputs</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (Visual): Fixed that the node for \"If Key Pressed (Rollback)\" converted to Code didn't do anything, because it never had code beyond creating and setting a temp variable to hold the key input state</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (Visual): Rollback node icons no longer all use the one \"dice\" image [see the Rollback section higher up for more]</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (Visual): Typing \"x\" and \"y\" in an instance's creation code editor will no longer also modify its Flip X/Y values in the room</li>",
      "\t<li>Note that there were actual several ways in which Room Editor commands could be accidentally triggered when typing in GML Visual editors which were open over the top of the room, and the fix above should resolve all of them</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (Visual): Using arrow keys whilst typing a comment incorrectly no longer switches the focus to a different node, will instead just move the caret as you would expect</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Footer no longer shows red after updating to a new GM version if a code editor was already open in your 2022.3 project layout</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Rollback variables \"player_id\" and \"player_local\" are now coloured as built-in variables</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Tab names now have the correct letter casing, rather than always only lowercase letters</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: [Windows IDE] Win+V dialog now pastes successfully from the clipboard</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: network_send_raw(), skeleton_animation_set() and skeleton_animation_set_ext() all now correctly have their final argument marked as optional in autocomplete</li>",
      "\t<li>Config Editor: No longer possible to open multiple editors at once, which could lead to incorrect values being saved in previous releases</li>",
      "\t<li>Debugger: Now displays the actual instance IDs and object type rather than raw references which were harder to understand what they meant</li>",
      "\t<li>Debugger: GM no longer hangs when debugging instance_create_layer() due to new \"ref\" type in 2022.6 / Debugger: GM no longer hangs when debugging projects which attempt to work with the new \"ref\" type in 2022.6</li>",
      "\t<li>Debugger: Originating code is now shown correctly when hitting a breakpoint located on a line which has } at the end</li>",
      "\t<li>Debugger: Fixed that sometimes the play button was not re-enabled after hitting a breakpoint</li>",
      "\t<li>Debugger: [Mac IDE] Maximised windows restored from a layout file are now correctly sized as soon as they appear (so no longer have to animate as it resizes to fix)</li>",
      "\t<li>Device Manager: [Mac IDE] Ubuntu hostname values are now automatically trimmed of any accidental whitespace at either end of the string, which stops \"Hostname not valid\" error when testing the connection to your newly-added device</li>",
      "\t<li>Device Manager: [Mac IDE] \"Launch Simulator\" for iOS and tvOS now launch the correct matching simulator every time, rather just asking Xcode to launch the last simulator used and therefore possibly being the wrong one for the platform being built that time</li>",
      "\t<li>Device Manager: [Switch] Fixed that \"Test Connection\" for a blank hostname always claimed it was successful because GameMaker attempted a check for USB-only EDEVs, but that check itself also required a fix - now, it the field is blank <i>and</i> no EDEV can be found on a USB port, then you get be the expected fail result</li>",
      "\t<li>Docs Integration: F1/MMB on a function name again opens the correct page (rather than just opening the manual's home page as it did in 2022.6.1)</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: \"delete\" now correctly flags GM1052 when called on constructor functions created by \"new\", which helps prevent unexpected in-game code errors</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: \"id\" in-built variable is no longer treated as read-only when assigned-to inside structs (e.g. \"self.id = 1;\"), which lead to incorrect GM1008 and GM1052 errors being raised in previous versions</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: \"player_id\" and all other rollback multiplayer variables no longer cause unexpected Error GM1013 messages</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: \"with\" loops can now recognise arbitrary expressions</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Adding an array into a map no longer shows an incorrect error (\"The type 'Array<Real>' appears where the type 'Id.DsMap' is expected\")</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Anonymous functions declared in another function's parameter initialisation are now found correctly whenever referenced elsewhere in your code</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Autocomplete is now much better at showing all matching results when typing a partial word if that term also comes after a special character in the result name (e.g., \"lis\" in \"ds_list_create\" would not work in previous releases) - note, however, that Feather is cleverer than the old Syntax Errors and so may legitimately/deliberately not show you as many results, but this is because it has ignored unwanted matches</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Autocompletion windows no longer disappear/flicker when typing long identifiers near the end of a file</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Comparing \"shader_current\" to -1 is now correctly allowed</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Console functions now all have the correct documentation and types in their tooltips and should be handled correctly</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Enum types as specified in JSDoc for parameters are now always respected thereafter, as Feather now assumes you know best - so do bear this in mind if you have accidentally typed the wrong value in your JSDoc!</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Expressions using accessors no longer give unexpected type errors which read as if the accessor was not being used</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed the drawing of function tooltips to now support any multi-line content which is defined in the JSDoc</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: GM no longer crashes when showing tooltip or auto-complete for expressions which contain recursive macros</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed inconsistencies in variable-resolution between auto-complete, tooltips, and Find All References</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed a crash in auto-complete and tooltips when resolving dot references from struct accessors into non-structs</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: GM no longer crashes with \"Non-Collection type cannot have element type\" error when enabling Feather in \"Test1\" project</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: GM no longer hangs for a second after every code edit in some projects/on some machines</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: GM no longer goes unstable when typing a dot after the square brackets of an array</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that GM1059 being raised against a function declaration line also blocked the parsing of that function's body, which stopped you from seeing other errors/warnings in that code</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: GM1061 (\"index might be out of range\") has now be removed as it was found to frequently give false-positives, which stopped it being useful in many situations</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: GM2043 is now correctly raised if an out-of-scope local variable is assigned to a new declaration of the same name</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Helper popups should now never cover the line of code the caret is on</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: If the JSDoc sets \"@returns Any\", that function's \"return\" command no longer always shows a warning about its type not being correct</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Immediate dot-access of a newly-defined struct literal no longer shows an unexpected Error GM1012 message</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Macro errors GM1038 and GM1051 are now always shown when the project's code causes them</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that macros were incorrectly marked as recursive in some cases, showing an unexpected GM1100 message</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that macros which define functions could result in failure to discover those functions when later used elsewhere in your code</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that per-Config macros did not rewrite correctly</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that the Messages panel highlight/selection could become offset from the mouse cursor when scrolling through lots of messages</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed multiple issues with interpreting arrays or structs created from passing an array into \"new\", such as that a Collection Type's Element Type was not promoted for arithmetic and binary infix operators</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that valid syntax in the format <i>new (function () constructor { ... })()</i> or <i>new array[i]()</i> were both incorrectly marked as an error</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Nullish operator Suggestion GM2061 is no longer shown when the code already has an \"else\" branch [fixes an issue where the Quick Fix action would incorrectly remove that \"else\" block in previous releases]</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that the output log could fill up with \"Unable to find function 'ent_player_Event_Create$$anon_function ...', which should exist!\" lines</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that pre-increment operators following a semicolon were incorrectly parsed as if \";++\"</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed various issues with using Quick Fix to perform JSDoc generation: mangling of pre-existing comment style; missing out tabs/spaces; omitting preceding and trailing comments or whitespace; omitting pre-existing @ignore, @deprecated, and @context attributes; mangling union types; that it occasionally resulted in unexpected \"function not found\" errors; and that it was not available for anonymous functions assigned to variables or struct literal members</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that JSDoc generation also did not correctly reparse all affected scripts after a change</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Removed JSDoc generation support for a global-scope script’s return statement, as this is deprecated functionality (if you want this, instead declare a function inside that script)</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that Quick Fix occasionally did nothing when you asked it to work on static variable declarations</li>",

      "\t<li>Preferences: Fixed that if you were using the Chinese language option for IDE Language, then certain fonts (such as JetBrains) use a substitute font for their Chinese glyphs, but that other font was not refreshed when the “parent” font was selected, which resulted in missing characters inside various parts of GameMaker</li>",
      "\t<li>Preferences: [SP] Fixed a typo in \"Reglas\" on Feather's Naming Rules section title</li>",

      "\t<li>You already have access to publish games on it (for free) as part of your Opera Account and you can also see <a href=\"https://gamemaker.io/en/tutorials/publish-to-gxgames-tutorial\" target=\"_blank\">our tutorial about what publishing on GX.games involves</a> if you want more info</li>",
      "\t<li>Also added a new \"os_gxgames\" constant (which duplicates the existing \"os_operagx\", so you do not need to change existing code) in order to be consistent in-game with this branding change</li>",

      "<h3>New Options For Texture Group Management</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>You will now find the texture groups editor has new controls for whether you want to split textures off into their own data files on disk during your builds, as this can be required by bigger games on some platforms which have memory caps on how much data you can have loaded at any moment (e.g., GX.games only allows 2GB)</li>",
      "\t<li>You can then use the matching 2022.9 runtimes to load/unload these groups in-game as you require</li>",

      "<h3>New Visual Node “Add Motion”</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>This new function takes a direction and speed and modifies the in-built hspeed and vspeed values accordingly - so you have the one node to manage, but can change several values at once behind-the-scenes (the node performs the following code: <i>hspeed += speed * dcos(direction); vspeed += speed * -dsin(direction);</i>)</li>",

      "\t<li>Opera Account login now has a proper error message when a timeout has happened, letting you know you simply need to try again</li>",
      "\t<li>Opera Account users would receive an unhelpful message in older GM versions when accidentally attempting to login by typing in their old username and password details - this message has now been improved to say your old details no longer work, now you have converted your account, and to simply use the Opera sign-in button instead</li>",
      "\t<li>The micro web server is now always stopped when the main IDE is closed, which stops a number of issues (such as “GameMaker is already running” when trying to install an update), but please be aware of this if you’re testing your games after closing GM itself</li>",
      "</ul>",

      "\t<li>Marketplace: Changed the package export/import processes to create a temporary drive, which fixes issues where extensions in the asset have really long file paths</li>",
      "\t<li>Note: This long filepaths issue affects the updated Google Play Licensing and APK Expansion extensions, so you need to use the 2.2.2 IDE to import these</li>",
      "\t<li>My Library: Fixed an issue with private assets not appearing if you had two versions of the asset and only one was private</li>",

      "\t<li>Fixed a Mac IDE crash if you're using a machine which has no audio devices at all</li>",

      "\t<li>Worked around the version of Visual Studio 2019 For Mac installs having a broken certificate-checker and causing errors when trying to compile projects in GMS2, so now it doesn't matter if you have VS2019 installed on your Mac or not</li>",
      "\t<li>Worked around the change in Catalina betas (or if you had installed Apple's broken Xcode command line tools update from June 3rd on Mojave) which causes startup crashes about system font errors</li>",

      "<h3>Ability to export assets as local packages</h3>",

      "<h3>Ability to turn off the file-system sandbox on desktop OSes</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Added Game Options into Windows/macOS/Ubuntu for disabling the file-system sandbox restrictions, so you can save/load files from anywhere not protected by the OS/other security software</li>",

      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Preferences > General Settings > Compiling now has a new setting \"Use subst for drive paths\" - disabling this will stop GMS2 mounting temp build folders as extra drives</li>",
      "\t<li>Note: Has no effect on building for Android, as Google's SDK files fall foul of this, so without this on you likely couldn't build Android on Windows</li>",
      "\t<li>Note: Has no effect on runtime downloads/installs either, so if your machine simply doesn't allow subst to run, this option won't stop you needing to resolve that before GMS2 can work properly</li>",

      "<h3>Validation of group names in the resource tree</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>All code and resource names have to be in Latin/Roman characters, but this was not applied properly to group names. Now that GMS2 allows exporting and importing local packages, this issue has been highlighted.</li>",
      "\t<li>Now, group names are validated properly when you try to rename them.</li>",
      "\t<li>Note: You should rename any non-Latin group names before trying to export any local/Marketplace packages, as the package will not be zipped properly</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Misc</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Custom Skins: All layout files in custom skins are now ignored, as these are unwanted anyway - stops issues seen in 2.2.2 with custom skins causing some editors to not appear properly</li>",
      "\t<li>Search & Replace: Changed the dialog so it doesn't select all the text to search for when the window is opened</li>",
      "\t<li>Room Editor: Fixed copy/pasting an instance to now keep the frame and image speed values you had set</li>",
      "\t<li>Room Editor: Fixed renaming a room when an instance inside that room has its creation code open would lose the code</li>",
      "\t<li>Room Editor: Changed the Instance Layer Properties window's instance cut/copy/paste/delete routine to reduce the amount of work done - particularly noticeable when there are thousands of instances in the room</li>",
      "\t<li>Room Editor: Fixed cutting tiles when any instance is also selected will silently delete that instance</li>",
      "\t<li>Preferences: Fixed resetting Text Editor > Code Editor > \"Document line limit\" to being -1 uncaps your limit, not restrict you from editing code files</li>",
      "\t<li>Preferences: Fixed needing to restart GMS2 after setting your Android/Amazon settings before Game Options can properly detect yor SDK installation</li>",
      "\t<li>Preferences: Added a setting for controlling the default sprite animation speed used in the Sprite Editor</li>",
      "\t<li>Sprite Editor: Fixed importing multiple sprites of different size to show the resize choice dialog, same as if you had added them via the Image Editor</li>",
      "\t<li>Sprite Editor: Will now by default apply scaling to \"custom origin\" values also, so the origin location always remains consistent for the new sprite size - Preference added to control this</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Fixed Enum colouring so the colouring still works properly if everything is declared on one line</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Fixed Syntax warnings for unused macros so they are now removed when you delete the macro line</li>",
      "\t<li>Resource Tree: Fixed a bug where stale views for Included Files were being left when the resources were removed, so reloading the project showed a missing files dialog</li>",
      "\t<li>General: Added the default context menu to all text fields in the IDE</li>",
      "\t<li>General: Added support for Shift+Insert, Shift+Delete, and Ctrl+Insert to all text fields/editors in the IDE</li>",
      "\t<li>General: Fixed some missing Mac IDE strings for things new in 2.2.2</li>",
      "\t<li>General: Fixed support for higher-than-60hz refresh rate monitors in the IDE - added a Preference for setting the maximum refresh rate (defaults to 60)</li>",
      "\t<li>Importing Projects: Fixed an issue with the project import repair tool so it correctly handles an issue with user views which could cause an \"Unable to find rooms\" error when compiling</li>",
      "\t<li>Image Editor: Changed the sprite controls overlay to be collapsed by default, added a Preference for controlling this</li>",
      "\t<li>DnD Editor: Changed camera focus on nodes to not centre the node (so you can see more of the chain) and also to be consistent whether you drag or double-click the toolbox button</li>",
      "\t<li>Compiler: Fixed issues building for Mac/iOS if your project name contains an &</li>",
      "\t<li>Output Window: Fixed issues with the panel not scrolling properly to match the actual end of the log</li>\t\t\t\t\t\t",

      "\t<li>Note: that this change by Apple means when building your games, before the package will work on any other machine the packages need to be submitted in Xcode to Apple and notarized</li>",
      "\t<li>Fixed an issue with project files being left open during builds longer than required, which should stop \"Too many files open\" build errors (all versions of macOS)</li>",

      "\t<li>Code Editor: Fixed that custom snippets were only appended to the defaults, they couldn't replace a default - snippets will now override if a duplicate keybinding is found</li>",
      "\t<li>Compiling: Fixed on some platforms the build timer didn't stop at the end of the build, instead it kept going until the game was also closed</li>",
      "\t<li>Compiling: Fixed an issue where changing the creation order of instances in the Room Editor could make double-clicking compiler errors open the wrong instance's code</li>",

      "<h3>Updated Licensing to Remove GPU Checks</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Some customers had issues where dual-GPUs in their machines meant moving the IDE between displays or toggling power-saving modes could cause their licence to be invalidated</li>",
      "\t<li>This GPU check has been removed, but now everyone needs to refresh their licence the first time they run 2.2.4 - please remember you will need an internet connection to achieve this</li>",
      "\t<li>Note, if you're using 2.2.4 on the same machine as 2.2.3 or older (e.g., you have a Steam install and a standalone), then be aware you will be asked to log-in again each time you start the IDE</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>macOS Catalina Support</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>This version of GMS2 is compliant with <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing_your_app_before_distribution\" target=\"blank\">Apple's new \"notarization\" system</a> - if you're using Catalina then it's important you update to this new version, or you will have issues making/running projects</li>",
      "\t<li>Note: that this change by Apple means when building your games, before the package will work on any other machine the packages need to be submitted in Xcode to Apple and notarized</li>",
      "\t<li>Fixed an issue with project files being left open during builds longer than required, which should stop \"Too many files open\" build errors (all versions of macOS)</li>",
      "\t<li>Changed the \"clean\" button to confirm if you need elevated permissions in order to clean files in your build folder (e.g., Apple Sign-In information) and then prompt you on the Mac if required</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Changed behaviour around saving empty code files</h3>",

      "\t<li><a href =\"https://bugs.yoyogames.com/view.php?id=30566\" target=\"blank\">Code files are now only created on disk if there is actually something to save</a> when the editor is closed the first time after creating the resource</li>",

      "<h3>Extended HTML5 Browser Launch Settings</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Changed the micro webserver into a console application, so you now won't see the UI pop up when you run your games - instead, all the server's logging will be in your Output Window</li>",
      "\t<li>Added Preferences for you to specify the default webserver URLs and port</li>",
      "\t<li>Added Device Manager support to pass command line arguments to the browser (e.g., start with the dev tools open)</li>",

      "\t<li>General: Changed GPU memory allocation for editor windows, which should result in better performance when moving between workspaces and/or running GMS2 for a while</li>",
      "\t<li>General: Fixed Help > Release Notes / Runtime Release notes link to be https versions, not http, to avoid issues where some users could not see the contents of the notes</li>",
      "\t<li>General: Fixed those above two links to send you to the correct versions of the notes if you're currently using a beta release without actually having opted-in</li>",
      "\t<li>Build Windows: Fixed Windows VM Steam builds to use the correct Steamworks dll version from your Steamworks install folder (YYC was fine)</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Fixed that custom snippets were only appended to the defaults, they couldn't replace a default - snippets will now override if a duplicate keybinding is found</li>",
      "\t<li>Compiling: Fixed on some platforms the build timer didn't stop at the end of the build, instead it kept going until the game was also closed</li>",

      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Lots and lots of project conversion issues have been fixed (and a number of you have recieved fixed copies of your projects already, so they're not listed below), however the vast majority were due to one of the following four reasons:</li>",
      "\t<li>1) The default texture/audio groups disappearing from the old project during the conversion process (the same issue which was affecting our own tutorials)</li>",
      "\t<li>2) Corrupt views referencing resources multiple times (so the project may have had issues in 2.2.5, saying it couldn't find files, etc.)</li>",
      "\t<li>3) DnD Scripts referencing multiple resources in unhandled ways</li>",
      "\t<li>4) Amazon's Game Options not upgrading properly from very old values to current ones</li>",

      "<h3>Bezier Curves</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Added a new curve type in the Curve Editor - Beziers allow you to ease in/out of curve points and fine-tune your animations</li>",
      "\t<li>Also made a number of improvements to manipulating curves used as position tracks on the Sequence Editor canvas - such as live preview/updating of the canvas area as you modify your curves and the ability to modify your bezier handles on the canvas itself</li>",

      "<h3>Dopesheet Curve Editor</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Further improving curve-editing, you can now edit your embedded curves right in the dopesheet within the Sequence Editor - toggle to the curve editing mode and make your changes to see the canvas update</li>",

      "\t<li>Closing or \"resetting\" a floating Dopesheet will restore it back to the default (bottom) snap</li>",
      "\t<li>Each Sequence has its own snap/floating setting so that you can do things like float the dopesheet for one sequence and see it alongside the dopesheet for another</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Sprite Broadcast Messages</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>2.3.0 added the ability for a sequence track to fire off Broadcast Messages, and now 2.3.1 brings the same functionality to all sprites</li>",

      "\t<li>Note that grouping the rooms has no effect on their order - this is still always performed top-to-bottom</li>",

      "<h3>Multiple New Package Formats</h3>",

      "\t<li>Windows x64 runner support (toggled via Game Options > Windows)</li>",
      "\t<li>ARMv7 packages for Ubuntu (GMS2 works this out dynamically depending on the architecture of the device you are targeting for that build)</li>",
      "\t<li>UWP multiple architectures in one package (part of the Create Exe button process)</li>",
      "\t<li>Should you have one, you will also find GMS2 itself and macOS games now run fine on your Apple Silicon developer-testing Mac</li>",

      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Misc Other Changes</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Changed the default sorting method used when importing a project to be Custom, so the Asset Browser order matches how the project looked before</li>",
      "\t<li>Changed the code-folding on { to be on the function line always, so that you don't get a dangling { as in 2.3.0 - also added a Preference to disable code-folding on { for those who only want to fold via regions</li>",
      "\t<li>Added a new Preference for whether you want changing the filtering of the asset browser to immediately re-expanded the groups or not (that the asset browser always expanded all groups each time you created an asset while the filter is active has been fixed)</li>",
      "\t<li>Have had to slightly change the Mac IDE keys for managing Bookmarks, as the old ones clashed with macOS hotkeys and so caused issues - setting a bookmark is now CMD+CTRL+[0-9] and jumping back to it later is CMD+[0-9]</li>",
      "\t<li>Within the Sequence Editor, you can now create Moment functions using the name you set in the text box, rather than having to create and then rename</li>",
      "\t<li>Added a Preference to edit the boiler plate comment shown at the top of a new Script Resource (or to turn it off if you want)</li>",
      "\t<li>Added a timeout to debugger connections - so now GMS2 will abort the build and show a \"Are you perhaps firewalled?\" if the debugger takes too long, rather than waiting indefinitely</li>",
      "\t<li>File > My Account will now use your default browser, rather than opening a browser workspace tab inside GMS2</li>",
      "\t<li>Lots of missing translations for 2.3.0 features have now been added, along with the translations for the new stuff in 2.3.1</li>",
      "\t<li>Added the $ symbol as a new accessor for structs (Which does mean if you have existing code for assigning HEX values to a variable then make sure you haven't wrapped this hex value in []s, as this would cause a compile error now)</li>",
      "\t<li>Removed some redundant arguments from buffer_get_surface(), so you will need to refactor any code using this function</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Bugs Fixed</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>AnimCurve Editor: \"Delete Curve\" tooltip does not support localisation</li>",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: Zoom resets to 100% on relaunch</li>",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: Keyboard navigation no longer functions after renaming an asset</li>",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: Duplicate groups appear on reloading project if group was moved and has an \"asset type\" name (e.g., the group is called \"Sprites\")</li>",

      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Lots and lots of project conversion issues have been fixed (and a number of you have recieved fixed copies of your projects already, so they're not listed below), however the vast majority were due to one of the following four reasons:</li>",
      "\t<li>1) The default texture/audio groups disappearing from the old project during the conversion process (the same issue which was affecting our own tutorials)</li>",
      "\t<li>2) Corrupt views referencing resources multiple times (so the project may have had issues in 2.2.5, saying it couldn't find files, etc.)</li>",
      "\t<li>3) DnD Scripts referencing multiple resources in unhandled ways</li>",
      "\t<li>4) Amazon's Game Options not upgrading properly from very old values to current ones</li>",
      "\t<li>If your project previously failed to convert in 2.3.0 (and we haven't already sent you a fixed copy), please try it again now. If it still fails, then please file a bug ticket and send us the project .yyz/.zip</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Bezier Curves</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Added a new curve type in the Curve Editor - Beziers allow you to ease in/out of curve points and fine-tune your animations</li>",
      "\t<li>Also made a number of improvements to manipulating curves used as position tracks on the Sequence Editor canvas - such as live preview/updating of the canvas area as you modify your curves and the ability to modify your bezier handles on the canvas itself</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Dopesheet Curve Editor</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Further improving curve-editing, you can now edit your embedded curves right in the dopesheet within the Sequence Editor - toggle to the curve editing mode and make your changes to see the canvas update</li>",
      "\t<li>Added a \"Height of Anim Curve Track in Dopesheet\" Preference so you can choose whether you want your curves to be double-height in the Dopesheet</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Snappable Dopesheet</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>And finally for curve-editing and the Sequence Editor, you can also now snap the Dopesheet to the top, bottom, left or right edges of the Sequence Editor ...or you can pop it out into its own floating window</li>",
      "\t<li>Closing or \"resetting\" a floating Dopesheet will restore it back to the default (bottom) snap</li>",
      "\t<li>Each Sequence has its own snap/floating setting so that you can do things like float the dopesheet for one sequence and see it alongside the dopesheet for another</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Sprite Broadcast Messages</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>2.3.0 added the ability for a sequence track to fire off Broadcast Messages, and now 2.3.1 brings the same functionality to all sprites</li>",

      "<h3>Room Manager Tools</h3>",

      "<h3>Removed The English Manual From The Installer</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>As more of you are using GMS2's localisation capabilities and choosing to work in your native languages, we have now removed the English manual from the GMS2 install to save a reasonable amount of download size and install space requirement</li>",
      "\t<li>The first time you access the manual inside GMS2 you will be asked if you want to download a local copy and work offline or if you're happy continuing with the online manual</li>",
      "\t<li>If you want to download the manual later on, or want to change your manual language, then you can do this via Preferences > General Settings > Help</li>",

      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Misc Other Changes</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Changed the default sorting method used when importing a project to be Custom, so the Asset Browser order matches how the project looked before</li>",
      "\t<li>Changed the code-folding on { to be on the function line always, so that you don't get a dangling { as in 2.3.0 - also added a Preference to disable code-folding on { for those who only want to fold via regions</li>",
      "\t<li>Added a new Preference for whether you want changing the filtering of the asset browser to immediately re-expanded the groups or not (that the asset browser always expanded all groups each time you created an asset while the filter is active has been fixed)</li>",
      "\t<li>Have had to slightly change the Mac IDE keys for managing Bookmarks, as the old ones clashed with macOS hotkeys and so caused issues - setting a bookmark is now CMD+CTRL+[0-9] and jumping back to it later is CMD+[0-9]</li>",
      "\t<li>Within the Sequence Editor, you can now create Moment functions using the name you set in the text box, rather than having to create and then rename</li>",
      "\t<li>Added a Preference to edit the boiler plate comment shown at the top of a new Script Resource (or to turn it off if you want)</li>",
      "\t<li>Added a timeout to debugger connections - so now GMS2 will abort the build and show a \"Are you perhaps firewalled?\" if the debugger takes too long, rather than waiting indefinitely</li>",
      "\t<li>File > My Account will now use your default browser, rather than opening a browser workspace tab inside GMS2</li>",
      "\t<li>Lots of missing translations for 2.3.0 features have now been added, along with the translations for the new stuff in 2.3.1</li>",
      "\t<li>Added the $ symbol as a new accessor for structs (Which does mean if you have existing code for assigning HEX values to a variable then make sure you haven't wrapped this hex value in []s, as this would cause a compile error now)</li>",
      "\t<li>Removed some redundant arguments from buffer_get_surface(), so you will need to refactor any code using this function</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Bugs Fixed</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>AnimCurve Editor: \"Delete Curve\" tooltip does not support localisation</li>",

      "\t<li>Asset Browser: Keyboard navigation no longer functions after renaming an asset</li>",

      "",
      "<h3>Nine Slice Support</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Nine Slices allow you to scale your sprites to stretch in a more controllable and smarter way, by keeping your corners at a fixed scale and stretching the bits in-between</li>",
      "\t<li>The Sprite Editor has a new Nine Slice panel where you can now enable this, and of course this new capability carries through into your game, where you can later manipulate the sprite at runtime should you wish</li>",
      "\t<li>Introduces the new functions sprite_nineslice_create(), sprite_set_nineslice() and sprite_get_nineslice(), as well as a number of in-built variables</li>",
      "\t<li>Note this feature requires a 2.3.2+ runtime also when building your project</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>AnimCurve Library</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>We have added a new library of preset curve types you can apply to your Bezier curves to automatically add points or change ease in/out values and easily add effects like \"bounce\" or \"elastic\"</li>",
      "\t<li>Presets can be applied to a whole curve or between selected points only</li>",
      "\t<li>Also added a ? button for opening the relevant manual page onto each of the AnimCurve Editor, the AnimCurve Library window, and the Sequence Editor</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>New IDE and Manual localisations</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>We have now added Brazilian-Portuguese, Chinese, and Russian translations into the IDE, the installer, and also the online/downloadable versions of our manual</li>",
      "\t<li>As a reminder, you can change your IDE language in <i>Preferences > General Settings</i> and your Help language in <i>Preferences > General Settings > Help</i></li>",
      "\t<li>Our www.yoyogames.com site also supports these languages and includes links to the translated manuals</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Use Your Default Browser For Our New Tutorials</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Continuing our drive to use external browsers for all website functionality and thereby improve usability, as well as reduce the GMS2 install size, the Start's Page's Tutorials will now open our website in your default browser outside GMS2</li>",
      "\t<li><a href=\"https://www.yoyogames.com/en/tutorials\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.yoyogames.com/en/tutorials</a> is our newly-updated and expanded website dedicated to tutorials and other learning resources, which allows filtering by proficiency level and also by the topics you're interested in</li>",
      "\t<li>Please note that we do not recommend continuing to use our old Start Page/Marketplace tutorials in 2.3.2+ IDEs, as these will have formatting issues and some problems with links to videos - these old assets will be removed from the Marketplace in future</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Mac DMG Export Package</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>If you are not building for the App Store, then when you click the Create Exe button now you will be given the choice of wrapping your new app in a .zip (as always) or a .dmg installer</li>",
      "\t<li>A new Game Option has been added to control the dmg installer's background image, and it will reuse the same icon as the game app uses</li>",
      "\t<li>Note this feature requires a 2.3.2+ runtime also when building your project</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Live Updating of the Colour Picker values</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Now, when spawning a colour picker in any applicable editor, you will be able to tweak your colours and see these apply in the main editor straight away - no more having to apply the colour change to see the update and then re-open the picker to make tweaks</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>New Sequence Playback DND Nodes</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Along with a small stack of fixes for other DND issues in this release, we have added some new nodes for controlling playback of your sequences:</li>",
      "\t<li>\"Sequence Get Length\", \"Sequence Get Head Position\", and \"Sequence Set Head Position\"</li>",
      "\t<li>Note this feature requires a 2.3.2+ runtime also when building your project</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Misc Important Changes To Be Aware Of</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>AnimCurve Editor: Added clearer UI messages to show when a curve is in an error state or invalid/not suitable for the operation you are trying to perform, which should allow you to quickly fix or pick a suitable replacement curve</li>",
      "\t<li>DnD Editor: Changed \"Start Following Path\" node's Relative->Absolute checkbox label, so now it matches how GML handles this functionality and also how recent GMS2 versions have actually handled the value in-game</li>",
      "\t<li>Local Packages: Fixed that collision events with assets not actually in the package were not imported because there was no matching second object to tie the event to and so the event information was lost from the object which was imported, so GMS2 will now create a new empty object of the required name in order to preserve the collision event information</li>",
      "\t<li>Project Load: Changed \"IdReferences which are not found\" compiler log warnings to be actual errors for you to resolve, rather than allowing the projects to keep building with broken in-game information. However, the error message now outputs what the exact issue is and where to fix it, so it's much easier to resolve your errors than in previous releases</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Other Bugs Fixed</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>AnimCurve Editor: Fixed that drag-select of curve points on the dopesheet would not highlight that section of curve also, instead only highlighted the individual points</li>",
      "\t<li>AnimCurve Editor: Changed the \"Curve Type\" button tooltip to match the new window title \"Animation Curve Library\"</li>",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: Fixed a typo in the Filters panel which used \"Folders First\" rather than the proper \"Groups First\"</li>",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: Fixed renaming Notes again to no longer require the stricter naming rules other in-game assets require</li>",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: [Mac IDE] Fixed that Cmd+D stopped working as an additional hotkey for duplicating assets</li>",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: Fixed that renaming a group required a further mouse click to reset focus before you could create new assets inside that group</li>",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: Fixed that shift-select operations did not work correctly if Ctrl was accidentally pressed also at any point during the operation</li>",
      "\t<li>Bookmarks: Fixed a crash when changing multiple bookmark locations whilst the Debugger was open</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Fixed that on some platforms the Create Executable actions were unresponsive and gave no error message if a project was already running</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Fixed that when GMS2 spawned any new Chromium browser instance (so, Chrome/Opera/Opera GX/Vivaldi, etc.) to do a HTML5 run, any further builds or clicking the stop button inside GMS2 would always kill that browser process even if you had opened other browser tabs in the meantime</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [HTML5] Fixed that debug runs did not apply any \"Prepend JS\" Game Options value in recent releases</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [HTML5] Fixed an issue where calling code such as \"static a=[]\" produced broken JS (a scope-less `gmla;` statement could be seen in the browser console)</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Xbox One] Fixed that the Asset Compiler did not process Stats 2013 manifest files when creating packages in recent versions</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Android YYC] Fixed that some larger projects could fail to build if they contain the throw() function</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [YYC] Fixed that functions could in some cases be compiled twice, leading to \"redefinition of 'gml_Script__...\" errors</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Fixed that the IDE got stuck when trying to compile an empty sound asset in recent versions and didn't alert you that the sound does not exist</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [macOS] Fixed that games failed to launch if built using Windows IDE and the project name contains \"(1)\"</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Fixed that sending a VM build build using GMS2 2.3.1 to Apple gives ERROR ITMS-90301: \"This bundle is invalid. Apple is not currently accepting applications built with this version of Xcode.\"</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Android] Added \"On New Intent\" support (for extensions which require this)</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Windows YYC] Added a helpful error message when builds fail because your VS batch file Preference value is incorrect</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: Fixed initialising the Steam .dll in 64bit Windows builds (fixed the filename being wrong in the created package)</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: Fixed an issue where timestamps on audio/texture cache files was not correct, so later builds might not overwrite these files properly</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Fixed that using the $ accessor directly with \"self\" returned an error when compiling projects</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [iOS] Fixed the Mac IDE being unable to build iOS projects using CocoaPods (\"Pod install result: /bin/bash: pod: command not found\")</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [iOS YYC] Fixed that the \"Building\" progress bar does not disappear when the build is actually finished</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Added more helpful error messages when builds due to Visual Studio batch file paths being incorrectly set in your Preferences</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Fixed that folding on an \"if\" could hide its \"else\" also if the else is on the same line as the if's closing brace</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Fixed that code folding did not treat multiple \"else if\" blocks independently</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Fixed an issue where having a function inside a macro breaks the surrounding code-folding after a couple of toggling folded/expanded</li>",

      "\t<li>Project Import: Changed project conversion \"Save As\" values to be as per regular imports, so it suggests a new project name matching the .yyz filename, etc.</li>",

      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Nine Slices allow you to scale your sprites to stretch in a more controllable and smarter way, by keeping your corners at a fixed scale and stretching the bits in-between</li>",
      "\t<li>The Sprite Editor has a new Nine Slice panel where you can now enable this, and of course this new capability carries through into your game, where you can later manipulate the sprite at runtime should you wish</li>",
      "\t<li>Introduces the new functions sprite_nineslice_create(), sprite_set_nineslice() and sprite_get_nineslice(), as well as a number of in-built variables</li>",

      "\t<li>Please note that we do not recommend continuing to use our old Start Page/Marketplace tutorials in 2.3.2+ IDEs, as these will have formatting issues and some problems with links to videos - these old assets will be removed from the Marketplace in future</li>",

      "<h3>Misc Important Changes To Be Aware Of</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>AnimCurve Editor: Added clearer UI messages to show when a curve is in an error state or invalid/not suitable for the operation you are trying to perform, which should allow you to quickly fix or pick a suitable replacement curve</li>",
      "\t<li>DnD Editor: Changed \"Start Following Path\" node's Relative->Absolute checkbox label, so now it matches how GML handles this functionality and also how recent GMS2 versions have actually handled the value in-game</li>",
      "\t<li>Local Packages: Fixed that collision events with assets not actually in the package were not imported because there was no matching second object to tie the event to and so the event information was lost from the object which was imported, so GMS2 will now create a new empty object of the required name in order to preserve the collision event information</li>",
      "\t<li>Project Load: Changed \"IdReferences which are not found\" compiler log warnings to be actual errors for you to resolve, rather than allowing the projects to keep building with broken in-game information. However, the error message now outputs what the exact issue is and where to fix it, so it's much easier to resolve your errors than in previous releases</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Other Bugs Fixed</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>AnimCurve Editor: Fixed that drag-select of curve points on the dopesheet would not highlight that section of curve also, instead only highlighted the individual points</li>",

      "\t<li>Asset Browser: [Mac IDE] Fixed that Cmd+D stopped working as an additional hotkey for duplicating assets</li>",

      "\t<li>Asset Browser: Fixed that shift-select operations did not work correctly if Ctrl was accidentally pressed also at any point during the operation</li>",
      "\t<li>Bookmarks: Fixed a crash when changing multiple bookmark locations whilst the Debugger was open</li>",

      "\t<li>Building Projects: Fixed that when GMS2 spawned any new Chromium browser instance (so, Chrome/Opera/Opera GX/Vivaldi, etc.) to do a HTML5 run, any further builds or clicking the stop button inside GMS2 would always kill that browser process even if you had opened other browser tabs in the meantime</li>",

      "\t<li>Code Editor: Fixed that code folding did not treat multiple \"else if\" blocks independently</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Fixed an issue where having a function inside a macro breaks the surrounding code-folding after a couple of toggling folded/expanded</li>",

      "\t<li>Nine Slices allow you to scale your sprites to stretch in a more controllable and smarter way, by keeping your corners at a fixed scale and stretching the bits in-between</li>",
      "\t<li>The Sprite Editor has a new Nine Slice panel where you can now enable this, and of course this new capability carries through into your game, where you can later manipulate the sprite at runtime should you wish</li>",
      "\t<li>Introduces the new functions sprite_nineslice_create(), sprite_set_nineslice() and sprite_get_nineslice(), as well as a number of in-built variables</li>",

      "\t<li>Please note that we do not recommend continuing to use our old Start Page/Marketplace tutorials in 2.3.2+ IDEs, as these will have formatting issues and some problems with links to videos - these old assets will be removed from the Marketplace in future</li>",

      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>AnimCurve Editor: Added clearer UI messages to show when a curve is in an error state or invalid/not suitable for the operation you are trying to perform, which should allow you to quickly fix or pick a suitable replacement curve</li>",
      "\t<li>DnD Editor: Changed \"Start Following Path\" node's Relative->Absolute checkbox label, so now it matches how GML handles this functionality and also how recent GMS2 versions have actually handled the value in-game</li>",
      "\t<li>Local Packages: Fixed that collision events with assets not actually in the package were not imported because there was no matching second object to tie the event to and so the event information was lost from the object which was imported, so GMS2 will now create a new empty object of the required name in order to preserve the collision event information</li>",
      "\t<li>Project Load: Changed \"IdReferences which are not found\" compiler log warnings to be actual errors for you to resolve, rather than allowing the projects to keep building with broken in-game information. However, the error message now outputs what the exact issue is and where to fix it, so it's much easier to resolve your errors than in previous releases</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Other Bugs Fixed</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>AnimCurve Editor: Fixed that drag-select of curve points on the dopesheet would not highlight that section of curve also, instead only highlighted the individual points</li>",

      "\t<li>Code Editor: Fixed that code folding did not treat multiple \"else if\" blocks independently</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Fixed an issue where having a function inside a macro breaks the surrounding code-folding after a couple of toggling folded/expanded</li>",

      "\t<li>Project Import: Changed project conversion \"Save As\" values to be as per regular imports, so it suggests a new project name matching the .yyz filename, etc.</li>",
      "\t<li>Project Load: Fixed that deleting Included Files externally while GMS2 was closed never scanned for these changes and so did   not clean the .yyp of the redundant information</li>",

    "release_notes": [
      "<h3>Added Windows/macOS Runtimes Into The Tnstaller</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Depending on which IDE installer you downloaded, you now have the matching runtime for just that one platform included inside the installer</li>",
      "\t<li>This means as soon as GMS2 is installed you can create/open projects and test them on Windows or macOS (so if you're a free licence user, then there are no further downloads required)</li>",
      "\t<li>(If your licence allows other modules, these will still be downloaded on startup as per normal)</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Removed Git Tools From The Installer</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>GMS2 now relies on external source control tools you point to in Preferences, rather than us shipping a specific version of the Git tools</li>",
      "\t<li>This means you can point at your own installed-and-configured Git client and use its own authentication settings, etc. It also means your tools can easily be kept up-to-date with external changes by Github, etc.</li>",
      "\t<li>Note 1: This does mean that if you were using source control inside GMS2 previously you will need to reconfigure your Git settings one time in Preferences before your projects are going to show as SCM-enabled!</li>",
      "\t<li>Note 2: The Mac IDE cannot push to an online repository if your keychain has not already been pre-configured with your password, etc., so when GMS2 detects this error we have added a dialog saying this and (briefly) how to fix</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>New Undo System</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>All undo and redo actions have been changed to use a new per-asset history system, which brings a few benefits:</li>",
      "\t<li>It's always going to be the most recent action which is undone - e.g., in previous releases if you create a Sprite, resize it in the Sprite Editor, open it in the Image Editor and add some content, then click the Sprite Editor and press Ctrl+Z it would be the resize which was undone rather than the Image Editor change. Now, focus is set back to the Image Editor and the last change there is undone (and pressing Undo again would step back through the change history for the asset as you would expect)</li>",
      "\t<li>It's also now possible to undo a change to an asset after you have closed its editor - as above, the editor would be reopened and the change performed</li>",
      "\t<li>If you do see any issues with undo/redo, then please do try to determine the precise steps to recreate the issue, otherwise we may need your project to be sent also with your ticket</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Fixes For High CPU Usage</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>The last couple of GMS2 releases have shown higher-than-expected CPU usage values on some machines (particularly on Windows), and this release aims to reduce that back down again</li>",
      "\t<li>In theory, you shouldn't see any issues and hopefully CPU usage values are considerably lower on your machine now - if you find your usage numbers have for some reason gone up noticeably, then please do file a ticket about this and include a project which shows the issue on your machine</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Updated FFmpeg Tools Version</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Should make importing and previewing sounds more reliable</li>",
      "\t<li>There was also a specific bug fix for Add Existing importing a single sound from another project could in some cases cause GMS2 to crash</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Additional Inspector Editors</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>These are: Objects (and individual object instances inside the Sequence Editor), Notes, Scripts, Sequences (and instances of), Shaders, and Tilesets</li>",
      "\t<li>Now, if any of these are selected the Inspector will populate with many of the settings relevant to that asset/instance</li>",
      "\t<li>If you multi-select items, then be aware only the relevant shared fields will be inspectable</li>",
      "\t<li>Another reminder that the Inspector can be accessed via Window > Inspector</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Misc Important Changes To Be Aware Of</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Now quickly checks .ogg/.wav sounds to see if they are actually valid before passing straight through to your game output folder, will force a recompile if issues are detected</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [HTML5] Added additional iframe focus-detection code in response to Itch.io/Newgrounds changes</li>",
      "\t<li>Room Editor: Instances in child rooms now always inherit variable values from their immediate parent room instead of the top-level room in their inheritance chain</li>",
      "\t<li>Variable Definitions: Child object List items which reference other variable definitions no longer give \"Undefined Variable\" compile errors during builds</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Other Bugs Fixed</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>AnimCurve Editor: Implemented little preview animations for all curves in the Curve Library</li>",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: Creating/renaming assets in groups no longer requires closing/opening the group to see the change</li>",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: Plugged a memory leak when adding resources to texture/audio groups</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Made a number of various improvements to stop large projects taking a very long time to compile for some users</li>",

      "\t<li>Building Projects: Cached Spine textures are now cleaned and rebuilt after changing texture page size settings</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Android YYC] The NDK 22 installation check now finds your install correctly when starting builds</li>",

      "\t<li>Debugger: Texture information is now correctly reported, flushing no longer continues to show old images</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (DnD): \"Create Sequence\" node no longer shows a red error tint when the Target field is empty (because this is a valid value)</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (DnD): \"Expression\" field of Apply To node now has a working autocomplete dialog</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (DnD): \"New Struct\" node's title no longer just says \"New\"</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (DnD): Asset fields on nodes' \"Drop here to assign ...\" message now correctly says \"asset\" instead of \"resource\"</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (DnD): Improved the Toolbox's search result sorting method</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (DnD): Using MMB on a function in an Object now opens the Script containing that function</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Do...Until statements now obey the \"Enable code-folding\" Preference, rather than always folding</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Fixed an exception in gutter tooltips if you incorrectly used [ ] instead of { } for code blocks (and we added a sensible tooltip for this coding mistake)</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: MMB or F1 on a function with the same name as its Script will now place the caret at the correct location for the function, rather than leaving it on line 1</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Code errors detected on a line after a comment written in Japanese will now blame the correct line number</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: weak_ref_create()'s \"ref\" variable no longer shows warnings</li>",

      "\t<li>Font Editor: GMS2 no longer goes unstable when quickly scrolling the fonts list</li>",
      "\t<li>Game Options: Android's Icons page is now able to load 32bit .png images</li>",
      "\t<li>Game Options: Android's Icons page's file picker now only allows .png files, which stops accidental build errors as only .pngs are allowed by the Android tools</li>",
      "\t<li>Note the above change is for the old/legacy Icons page - it does not affect the newer Adaptive Icons page, as GMS2 will always save a suitable .png for you when using that tool</li>",
      "\t<li>Game Options: UWP's Title ID can now be set reliably, rather than maybe forcing \"16777216\" (depending on your actual unique ID)</li>",

      "\t<li>Room Editor: Painting tiles to a new tile layer now flags the project as requiring a save</li>",

      "\t<li>Room Editor: Duplicating a room now preserves its instance creation order values</li>",

      "\t<li>Startup: GMS2 will no longer prompt you every launch to use the original runtime if you're using a newer runtime than the IDE shipped with (it will still tell you to update old runtimes!)</li>",
      "\t<li>Startup: Avast/AVG will no longer incorrectly warn US/UK/European users that GMS2 is attempting to connect to \"a botnet server\" because Avast briefly did not like Baidu's site</li>",

    "release_notes": [
      "<h2>Changes since IDE 2.3.3.570</h2>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: A further fix for MMB/F1 on functions with the same name as its Script to place the caret on the correct line even in fullscreen code editors in separate workspace tabs</li>",
      "\t<li>Image Editor: Fixed the Reverse Frames menu command not working in IDE v2.3.3.570</li>",
      "\t<li>Undo: Stopped GMS2 going unstable when undo-ing placing an asset in the Room Editor</li>",
      "\t<li>Sprite Editor: Fixed the abilty to add multiple images at once</li>",
      "\t<li>Note: We are aware that if the images are different sizes, then this currently triggers a redundant file-watcher prompt</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "",
      "<h2>IDE 2.3.3.570</h2>",
      "<h3>Added Windows/macOS Runtimes Into The Installer</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Depending on which IDE installer you downloaded, you now have the matching runtime for just that one platform included inside the installer</li>",
      "\t<li>This means as soon as GMS2 is installed you can create/open projects and test them on Windows or macOS (so if you're a free licence user, then there are no further downloads required)</li>",
      "\t<li>(If your licence allows other modules, these will still be downloaded on startup as per normal)</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Removed Git Tools From The Installer</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>GMS2 now relies on external source control tools you point to in Preferences, rather than us shipping a specific version of the Git tools</li>",
      "\t<li>This means you can point at your own installed-and-configured Git client and use its own authentication settings, etc. It also means your tools can easily be kept up-to-date with external changes by Github, etc.</li>",
      "\t<li>Note 1: This does mean that if you were using source control inside GMS2 previously you will need to reconfigure your Git settings one time in Preferences before your projects are going to show as SCM-enabled!</li>",
      "\t<li>Note 2: The Mac IDE cannot push to an online repository if your keychain has not already been pre-configured with your password, etc., so when GMS2 detects this error we have added a dialog saying this and (briefly) how to fix</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>New Undo System</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>All undo and redo actions have been changed to use a new per-asset history system, which brings a few benefits:</li>",
      "\t<li>It's always going to be the most recent action which is undone - e.g., in previous releases if you create a Sprite, resize it in the Sprite Editor, open it in the Image Editor and add some content, then click the Sprite Editor and press Ctrl+Z it would be the resize which was undone rather than the Image Editor change. Now, focus is set back to the Image Editor and the last change there is undone (and pressing Undo again would step back through the change history for the asset as you would expect)</li>",
      "\t<li>It's also now possible to undo a change to an asset after you have closed its editor - as above, the editor would be reopened and the change performed</li>",
      "\t<li>If you do see any issues with undo/redo, then please do try to determine the precise steps to recreate the issue, otherwise we may need your project to be sent also with your ticket</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Fixes For High CPU Usage</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>The last couple of GMS2 releases have shown higher-than-expected CPU usage values on some machines (particularly on Windows), and this release aims to reduce that back down again</li>",
      "\t<li>In theory, you shouldn't see any issues and hopefully CPU usage values are considerably lower on your machine now - if you find your usage numbers have for some reason gone up noticeably, then please do file a ticket about this and include a project which shows the issue on your machine</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Updated FFmpeg Tools Version</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Should make importing and previewing sounds more reliable</li>",
      "\t<li>There was also a specific bug fix for Add Existing importing a single sound from another project could in some cases cause GMS2 to crash</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Additional Inspector Editors</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>These are: Objects (and individual object instances inside the Sequence Editor), Notes, Scripts, Sequences (and instances of), Shaders, and Tilesets</li>",
      "\t<li>Now, if any of these are selected the Inspector will populate with many of the settings relevant to that asset/instance</li>",
      "\t<li>If you multi-select items, then be aware only the relevant shared fields will be inspectable</li>",
      "\t<li>Another reminder that the Inspector can be accessed via Window > Inspector</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Misc Important Changes To Be Aware Of</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Now quickly checks .ogg/.wav sounds to see if they are actually valid before passing straight through to your game output folder, will force a recompile if issues are detected</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [HTML5] Added additional iframe focus-detection code in response to Itch.io/Newgrounds changes</li>",
      "\t<li>Room Editor: Instances in child rooms now always inherit variable values from their immediate parent room instead of the top-level room in their inheritance chain</li>",
      "\t<li>Variable Definitions: Child object List items which reference other variable definitions no longer give \"Undefined Variable\" compile errors during builds</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Other Bugs Fixed</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>AnimCurve Editor: Implemented little preview animations for all curves in the Curve Library</li>",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: Creating/renaming assets in groups no longer requires closing/opening the group to see the change</li>",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: Plugged a memory leak when adding resources to texture/audio groups</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Made a number of various improvements to stop large projects taking a very long time to compile for some users</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Tilesets now always update correctly when building your projects after importing a replacement source image - even if \"Disable Source Sprite Export\" is disabled also</>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Cached Spine textures are now cleaned and rebuilt after changing texture page size settings</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Android YYC] The NDK 22 installation check now finds your install correctly when starting builds</li>",

      "\t<li>Building Projects: [HTML5] Running a freshly-imported project for Windows and then HTML5 straight after no longer gives corrupted/missing visuals in that first HTML5 build</li>",
      "\t<li>Building projects: [iOS YYC] Mac IDE fix for the error 'tell app \\\\\"Xcode\\\\\" to quit' which appears for some users</li>",
      "\t<li>Colour Picker: Hue, Sat, and Val sliders all now work again</li>",
      "\t<li>Debugger: Collision events and associated scripts when the \"other\" object is a parent are now shown correctly</li>",
      "\t<li>Debugger: Using a \"Step ...\" command whilst on a line with an error no longer skips showing you that error</li>",
      "\t<li>Debugger: Lines that call \"delete\" are now stepped-into properly</li>",
      "\t<li>Debugger: Texture information is now correctly reported, flushing no longer continues to show old images</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (DnD): \"Create Sequence\" node no longer shows a red error tint when the Target field is empty (because this is a valid value)</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (DnD): \"Expression\" field of Apply To node now has a working autocomplete dialog</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (DnD): \"New Struct\" node's title no longer just says \"New\"</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (DnD): Asset fields on nodes' \"Drop here to assign ...\" message now correctly says \"asset\" instead of \"resource\"</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (DnD): Improved the Toolbox's search result sorting method</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (DnD): Using MMB on a function in an Object now opens the Script containing that function</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Do...Until statements now obey the \"Enable code-folding\" Preference, rather than always folding</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Fixed an exception in gutter tooltips if you incorrectly used [ ] instead of { } for code blocks (and we added a sensible tooltip for this coding mistake)</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: MMB or F1 on a function with the same name as its Script will now place the caret at the correct location for the function, rather than leaving it on line 1</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Code errors detected on a line after a comment written in Japanese will now blame the correct line number</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: weak_ref_create()'s \"ref\" variable no longer shows warnings</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: GMS2 no longer crashes if any JSDoc contains )( after @func name [also if \"@func\" was repeated elsewhere in your comment]</li>",
      "\t<li>Demos: Importing some older official demos no longer shows an unwanted \"Old Project Format\" dialog</li>",
      "\t<li>Font Editor: GMS2 no longer goes unstable when quickly scrolling the fonts list</li>",
      "\t<li>Game Options: Android's Icons page is now able to load 32bit .png images</li>",
      "\t<li>Game Options: Android's Icons page's file picker now only allows .png files, which stops accidental build errors as only .pngs are allowed by the Android tools</li>",
      "\t<li>Note the above change is for the old/legacy Icons page - it does not affect the newer Adaptive Icons page, as GMS2 will always save a suitable .png for you when using that tool</li>",
      "\t<li>Game Options: UWP's Title ID can now be set reliably, rather than maybe forcing \"16777216\" (depending on your actual unique ID)</li>",

      "\t<li>Object Editor: Physics Collision Shape window now shows the whole of an image again, rather than only part of larger sprites</li>",
      "\t<li>Object Editor: Restored the ability to drag an Object asset onto another Object's Events window to quickly create a Collision Event between the two</li>",
      "\t<li>Object Editor: Stopped GMS2 going unstable when right-clicking events if the parent object has been lost from the project for some reason</li>",
      "\t<li>Preferences: Go To's section no longer says \"Search in Resources\" rather than \"assets\", also restored the preference for \"Search in Game Options\" which had been lost</li>",
      "\t<li>Preferences: Visual Studio's batch file picker filter now allows picking a VsDevCmd.bat file also (various screens within Preferences)</li>",
      "\t<li>Preferences: Fixed that installing Android Studio 4.2 and interacting with a keystore in any way inside GMS2 resulted in a \"JDK not installed correctly\" error</li>",
      "\t<li>Project Import: Converted projects no longer lose their Room Editor background colour and alpha values</li>",
      "\t<li>Project Import: Fixed an issue where some 2.2.5 DND projects suffer function creation errors in some scripts during conversion</li>",
      "\t<li>Project Import: GMS2 no longer hangs on failing to import a .yyz from inside a .zip file and instead attempting to import a project from inside a .zip file now says you need to extract the .zip first</li>",
      "\t<li>Project Import: Large amounts of Spine/SWF files in a project being converted no longer trip up the Asset Compiler while generating IconCache previews</li>",
      "\t<li>Project Import: Projects with long load/save/conversion times no longer give very odd load/save time values in your output window and ui.log</li>",
      "\t<li>Project Import: Projects with very large amounts of resources no longer cause thread issues in SourceControlAction and potentially cause the import/convert to fail</li>",
      "\t<li>Room Editor: Instance sprites now update immediately in open Room Editors when a replacement image is imported in the Sprite Editor</li>",
      "\t<li>Room Editor: Painting tiles to a new tile layer now flags the project as requiring a save</li>",
      "\t<li>Room Editor: Undoing the drawing of tiles now saves this change properly, which means you won't still see the stale tiles in-game or when reopening the room</li>",
      "\t<li>Room Editor: Can now delete instances after using \"Select from Any Layer (P)\" when on a Tile Layer</li>",
      "\t<li>Room Editor: Duplicating a room now preserves its instance creation order values</li>",
      "\t<li>Room Editor: Reordering the instance creation order list now flags the project needs to be saved, so builds will now pick up the change correctly</li>",
      "\t<li>Search & Replace: Can now dismiss the dialog by pressing the Esc key on your keyboard if no field with content is selected</li>",
      "\t<li>Search & Replace: Esc key now always clears the currently-selected field if it has any content (previous versions only cleared the field if you had also just edited it)</li>",

    "version": "2.3.4.577",
    "release_notes": [
      "<h3>Ubuntu IDE Beta</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>We are pleased to offer a new Ubuntu IDE beta for you to try (requires Ubuntu 20.04.n LTS) - more info on this can be found on <a href=\"https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018353352\" target=\"_blank\">the \"How to get Betas\" FAQ</a></li>",
      "\t<li>Please note as per the other IDEs, we do not support virtual machine OSes and that this is the only Linux distro we offer official support for in this Beta</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Changed All IDE Input And Audio Output To Use SDL2</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>This is a huge internal change, but you will hopefully only see that it fixes a number of minor differences in keyboard/mouse and file dragging-and-dropping support Windows IDE vs Mac IDE</li>",
      "\t<li>Also fixes a few issues with copy/pasting clipboard contents between GMS2 and other applications - especially in the Mac IDE</li>",
      "\t<li>Note for specifically Windows 7 users: the Windows IDE's legacy graphics tablet driver integration has now been removed as part of this change and we cannot guarantee that your own tablet driver is supported</li>",
      "\t<li>However, because of that change, the IDE's startup sequence on Windows 7 is now much more reliable - if you had occasional crashes where your log ended on a line about the tablet driver, those crashes will be gone now</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Changed All IDE Rendering To Use FNA3D</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Again, this is a huge internal change, but you will hopefully only see that it fixes a number of minor differences in rendering between Windows IDE vs Mac IDE</li>",
      "\t<li>Will allow future versions of GMS2 to better support users who have multiple monitors with different DPI values or dragging between a laptop screen and an external monitor, for example</li>",
      "\t<li>Also allows us to prepare for future versions of the IDE being rendered with Metal on new macOS versions and to switch Windows IDE rendering to DirectX and avoid some GPU driver startup crash issues for some users</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Stability Fixes For When You Do Not Have Internet Access</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Fixed a startup crash when trying to activate runtimes if you are offline during GMS2's startup</li>",
      "\t<li>Note that the crash above only happened when your original install failed slightly due to permission issues and so no runtime has ever successfully set itself as active in your settings files. This fix will allow GMS2 to safely start, but you will be asked to reinstall your runtimes one more time</li>",
      "\t<li>Please see <a href=\"https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022953052\" target=\"_blank\">our permissions FAQ</a> to ensure this installation works smoothly, otherwise you may continue to have some issues working offline</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Extension Editor \"Injection\" UI Changes</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>The code injection panels inside the Extension Editor (Android and iOS) now rely on you passing in XML to indicate what should be injected and where, as there are now so many places gradle can inject to that adding a panel for each would have made the editor very messy</li>",
      "\t<li>If you have projects which make use of the existing injection functionality please do make a backup before you open them the first time and then review them carefully in this version, as you might need to make changes to your setup - any issues, please send us a bug report and include a copy of your backup</li>",
      "\t<li>Be aware that existing injection content will be updated into the new format the first time you edit any existing content, so after you make changes you would not be able to use this extension in 2.3.3-or-older again without having to remove and re-add your injection setup using the old format</li>",
      "\t<li>Please see the manual for an updated overview of the extension editor, plus we have now merged our Helpdesk guides on how to create simple extensions for a variety of platforms into the manual so everything is in one place</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Code Samples In The Manual Are Now Multi-Coloured</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>All code sample blocks in the manual are now syntax-highlighted using GMS2's default code editor colour scheme (Note: if you have customised your editor colours, this won't affect the manual)</li>",
      "\t<li>Helps with legibility of the samples, but also helps new users follow what is a custom variable, what is an in-built variable, what is a function, what is a macro, etc.</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Misc Important Changes To Be Aware Of</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Already mentioned above, but important enough to repeat: many YYC/UWP/console platforms now support Visual Studio 2019 only, so please see <a href=\"https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/227860547\" target=\"_blank\">the Required SDKs FAQ</a> for specifics</li>",
      "\t<li>Room Editor: Named instances reuse their same ID when duplicating that room [note this fix is only to stop the issue happening again now - it will not automatically refactor projects already in this state, so this is something you may need to fix manually]</li>",
      "\t<li>In all versions since 2.3.0 the Sequence Editor would forcibly save your project each time you closed the editor (so closing GMS2 and saying \"no\" to your unsaved changes may have saved them anyway). Other recent changes for the saving and undo systems made this forcible save redundant, so we have now stopped the IDE from always saving your projects every time you close any Sequence Editor window. Please bear this in mind when interacting with save confirmation prompts</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3> Other Bugs Fixed </h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: Dragging-and-dropping a parent folder into the asset browser now maintains the parent/child folder structure</li>",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: Fixed Add Existing with objects with the same name of existing objects so that the correct code content is pulled in from the other project</li>",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: Fixed a \"completely empty IdReference\" error when loading some projects which caused the Room Manager to not show all rooms in the project, GMS2 may also have gone unstable after loading the project</li>",
      "\t<li>Note that the above fix will make the rooms appear in the room manager window again and will stop the \"unstable\", but the order of those rooms has been lost and so you would need to set that again one time</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [YYC] Use of anonymous functions no longer generate \"expression result unused\" warnings</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Android] Display Names which contain an apostrophe no longer cause builds to fail</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (DnD): The \"Comments\" font is now fixed (after being thinner in 2.3.3)</li>",
      "\t<li>Debugger: Games no longer crash silently when hovering over certain variables in the Debugger's code editor panel</li>",
      "\t<li>Docs Integration: Async \"HTTP\" section's manual pages now load correctly when using a downloaded manual .zip</li>",
      "\t<li>File Watcher: The Sprite Editor no longer triggers FW dialogs when Importing multiple images of different sizes at once</li>",

      "\t<li>We are pleased to offer a new Ubuntu IDE beta for you to try (requires Ubuntu 20.04.n LTS) - more info on this can be found on <a href=\"https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018353352\" target=\"_blank\">the \"How to get Betas\" FAQ</a></li>",

      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Changed All IDE Input And Audio Output To Use SDL2</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>This is a huge internal change, but you will hopefully only see that it fixes a number of minor differences in keyboard/mouse and file dragging-and-dropping support Windows IDE vs Mac IDE</li>",
      "\t<li>Also fixes a few issues with copy/pasting clipboard contents between GMS2 and other applications - especially in the Mac IDE</li>",
      "\t<li>Note for specifically Windows 7 users: the Windows IDE's legacy graphics tablet driver integration has now been removed as part of this change and we cannot guarantee that your own tablet driver is supported</li>",
      "\t<li>However, because of that change, the IDE's startup sequence on Windows 7 is now much more reliable - if you had occasional crashes where your log ended on a line about the tablet driver, those crashes will be gone now</li>",

      "\t<li>Again, this is a huge internal change, but you will hopefully only see that it fixes a number of minor differences in rendering between Windows IDE vs Mac IDE</li>",
      "\t<li>Will allow future versions of GMS2 to better support users who have multiple monitors with different DPI values or dragging between a laptop screen and an external monitor, for example</li>",
      "\t<li>Also allows us to prepare for future versions of the IDE being rendered with Metal on new macOS versions and to switch Windows IDE rendering to DirectX and avoid some GPU driver startup crash issues for some users</li>",

      "\t<li>Fixed a startup crash when trying to activate runtimes if you are offline during GMS2's startup</li>",
      "\t<li>Note that the crash above only happened when your original install failed slightly due to permission issues and so no runtime has ever successfully set itself as active in your settings files.

      "\t<li>Be aware that existing injection content will be updated into the new format the first time you edit any existing content, so after you make changes you would not be able to use this extension in 2.3.3-or-older again without having to remove and re-add your injection setup using the old format</li>",

      "\t<li>In all versions since 2.3.0 the Sequence Editor would forcibly save your project each time you closed the editor (so closing GMS2 and saying \"no\" to your unsaved changes may have saved them anyway).

      "\t<li>Added a new Preference to always silently stop any existing run when clicking to create an executable, and then carry on with the new build as normal</li>",
      "\t<li>Note this defaults to \"off\" (so you won't see any change) and you can enable it via Preferences > General Settings > Compiling > \"Automatically stop running before packaging\"</li>",

      "<h3>Startup Tweak For Web Server Port Check</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Instead of checking your webserver port every startup, GMS2 will now only check this at the time you actually try to start the webserver (e.g., running a HTML5 game or opening the manual <i>if</i> the Preference to use the local manual is actually enabled)</li>",
      "\t<li>Note you would still see the dialog at these times if your port remains blocked, so you should continue to see our Permissions FAQ for more info on how to fix this, as GMS2 will not create firewall rules for you</li>",

      "<h3>Misc Important Changes To Be Aware Of</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: [2.3.5] Removed the restriction on included files with names beginning with a number, as this is no longer required on current Apple OS versions [be careful claiming backwards support, though]</li>",
      "\t<li>Game Options: Android's product information fields no longer allow you to type in hyphens, as we have had tickets from a few users who had typed this and caused Gradle to error when building the project</li>",
      "\t<li>Note: If your project already has hyphens in any of these three text fields, please remove them now, as otherwise your build will fail</li>",
      "\t<li>Project Load: Added more logging for \"completely empty ID reference\" errors and also a fix to more reliably tell you the name of the asset(s) affected, so that you can fix your projects more easily</li>",
      "\t<li>Note: If you have a project which has this issue, please <b>back it up first</b>, but then do try it in this version and to attempt to fix your issue - if you are unable, send us the backup in a ticket</li>",
      "\t<li>Project Save: Fixed a versioning issue which meant importing a 2.3.4-format extension into 2.3.3 and then deleting the extension in the Asset Browser deletes the entire project [2.3.5 will now export files safe to use in those old IDEs]</li>",

      "\t<li>Code Editor (DnD): Dragging a script into an \"Execute Script\" node now actually assigns it to the node, rather than just opening it elsewhere</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Accidentally adding double brackets when calling a function no longer gives a large parser error tooltip in the gutter</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Fixed user-defined shortcuts for code snippets being broken in 2.3.4</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: [Mac IDE] Undo will no longer modify multiple lines if a mouse click was used to move the caret to a different line, rather than Enter</li>",
      "\t<li>Debugger: Stepping code functionality no longer navigates in some circumstances to a line that is not actually getting called</li>",
      "\t<li>Debugger: Fixed the Reset Layout menubar command so it actually removes your layout file and therefore resets your layout</li>",

      "\t<li>Image Editor: [Mac IDE] Copy-pasting a frame no longer pastes it twice</li>",

      "\t<li>Inspector: [Tile Set] The preview area now shows the usual checkerboard to represent empty Tile Sets</li>",
      "\t<li>Install: Setting your installer language to Brazilian Portuguese or Russian now correctly changes the initial IDE language to be the same</li>",
      "\t<li>Install: Cleaned the Windows installer of any no-longer-used \"components\" packages for old versions of .NET and Visual C Runtime</li>",
      "\t<li>Project Load: Fixed GMS2 crashing when converting old-format (1.4 or 2.2.5) projects if you have certain newer targets on your licence</li>",
      "\t<li>Project Load: Made GMS2 more reliably able to load some corrupted projects and therefore recover as much as possible</li>",
      "\t<li>Project Save: GMS2 no longer goes unstable after importing some assets which use room inheritance from Local Packages and then deleting those assets</li>",
      "\t<li>Project Save: Resources created in the root of a project and then immediately moved into a group now save correctly again</li>",
      "\t<li>Project Save: GMS2 now automatically removes trailing whitespace in asset names rather than showing a filename error about the unwanted space character</li>",
      "\t<li>Sprite Editor: You can no longer resize the first frame into a negative value - fixes a minor UI issue with the editor not handling this properly and updating the time bar</li>",
      "\t<li>Startup: Added more logging to track down a rare startup crash \"You must write ContentLength bytes to the request stream before calling [Begin]GetResponse\" in the ui.log</li>",
      "\t<li>Startup: Added a fix for the Mac IDE getting an error about not being able to download and install Mono (it says a runtime could not be installed, but this was the Mono installer itself)</li>",
      "\t<li>Startup: Now only checks if the manual port is open if Preference to use the local manual is actually enabled [see the info in the section for this above]</li>",
      "\t<li>UI/UX: GMS2 is no longer able to create multiple Confirm Quit dialogs (it will just reuse the one), which stops an odd crash from happening</li>",
      "\t<li>UI/UX: Made a fix for ignoring all shortcuts when focus is in a text editor - now correctly handles suitable shortcuts again (e.g., Ctrl+S to save your project)</li>",
      "\t<li>UI/UX: Cmd+T and Ctrl+T now function properly again</li>",

      "<h3>Added Two New \"Nullish\" Operators</h3>",

      "    \t<li>Also added a matching assignment operator - called via code such as <i>variable ??= expression</i> - which will check <i>variable</i> to see if it is either <i>undefined</i> or pointer_null, and if is is then it will assign <i>expression</i> to <i>variable</i>, otherwise it does nothing</li>",

      "\t<li>However, it is possible that you might want an individual sound to always ensure that it is compiled by GMS2 before it is added to your project cache folder, so we have now added an option for this into the Sound Editor</li>",

      "\t<li>Added support for importing and using Spine 4.0 images in your games</li>",
      "\t<li>However, be aware that due to the way the Spine runtime only supports one version at a time, you will need to use Spine 4.0 to re-export all of your assets for your projects before they will work now</li>",

      "\t<li>Several \"flow keys\" such as Alt/Ctrl/Tab, etc., are now configurable if you wish - this can be done in Preferences > Redefine Keys</li>",
      "\t<li>Partly because of this change, the Workspace Overview panel has now changed so that if you use a key combo which uses a flow key (such as the default of Ctrl+Tab), then you need to hold down the Ctrl like you always did in older versions of GMS2, but if you rebind the key combo to not use a flow key (e.g. just Tab), then you now do not need to keep holding down Tab to keep the window open</li>",

After that, you will be able to sign-in to GMS2 using the Opera account each time.</li>",

      "<h3>Added Ability To Omit Arguments On Function Calls</h3>",

      "    \t<li>Also added a matching assignment operator - called via code such as <i>variable ??= expression</i> - which will check <i>variable</i> to see if it is either <i>undefined</i> or pointer_null, and if is is then it will assign <i>expression</i> to <i>variable</i>, otherwise it does nothing</li>",

      "    <li>Note: The contents of the layer type dropdown does depend on which runtime is currently active, so you will only see these if using 2.3.7 runtimes</li>",
      "    <li>There are also some visual improvements to the Desaturate and Large Blur layers (this one also gains a room editor performance fix)</li>",

      "<h3>Added Ability To Forcibly Recompile Individual Sounds</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>A while ago, we introduced a change where GMS2 assumes that a sound asset using an .ogg file type is already in the format you want and won't recompile the .ogg file if the Sound Editor's settings match a quick scan of contents of the .ogg</li>",
      "\t<li>However, it is possible that you might want an individual sound to always ensure that it is compiled by GMS2 before it is added to your project cache folder, so we have now added an option for this into the Sound Editor</li>",
      "\t<li>Be aware that this will force that sound to recompile each build, so you may wish to only tick this option when required</li>",

      "\t<li>There is a new setting in the Font Editor for saying whether you wish to ignore the kerning information within the font</li>",
      "\t<li>Note: a reminder that different fonts may legitimately need different interpreter versions to be used in the font editor's options for that font asset, so you might want to check these options first if you have issues with a font</li>",

      "<h3>Updated Spine Support To Target v4.0</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Added support for importing and using Spine 4.0 images in your games</li>",
      "\t<li>However, be aware that due to the way the Spine runtime only supports one version at a time, you will need to use Spine 4.0 to re-export all of your assets for your projects before they will work now</li>",
      "\t<li>If you have any old-format Spine sprites in your project, then you will be shown an error for these when trying to build the game</li>",

      "\t<li>Note: If you have any Android extensions in your projects be aware these may need fixes in order to support building with API 31+, as Google have introduced a number of changes</li>",

      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Changes to Workspace Overview Window's Control Scheme (Ctrl+Tab)</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Several \"flow keys\" such as Alt/Ctrl/Tab, etc., are now configurable if you wish - this can be done in Preferences > Redefine Keys</li>",
      "\t<li>Partly because of this change, the Workspace Overview panel has now changed so that if you use a key combo which uses a flow key (such as the default of Ctrl+Tab), then you need to hold down the Ctrl like you always did in older versions of GMS2, but if you rebind the key combo to not use a flow key (e.g. just Tab), then you now do not need to keep holding down Tab to keep the window open</li>",

      "<h3>New Version Numbering Format</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>The new numbering format for both the IDE and the runtimes uses a year.release.update.buildnumber format, which should make it clearer when a version was released and when a newer one is available, etc.</li>",
      "\t<li>In order to avoid any confusion with similar build numbers between beta and stable releases, Betas will call themselves release \"100\" of that year - if you took part in January's Betas, you would have seen this version became 2022.100.0.buildnumber</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Licensing Change To Reduce Your Session Count When Using Multiple Installs</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Sessions are now simply \"one for the host machine\" instead of \"one per-IDE install on that machine\"</li>",
      "\t<li>This means if you're using (for example) a Stable and a Beta install or Steam and non-Steam installs on a single physical machine, then this will only create one session going forward, rather than multiple as GMS2 has done to this point</li>",
      "\t<li>Note:<b> This change will invalidate your current IDE session and so you will need to log in again one time, the next time you start GMS2</b></li>",
      "\t<li><i>You may also need to revoke your old sessions on your account's web panel one time if you receive errors about having too many sessions active</i></li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>More Robust Runtime Download And Activation Processes</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>As well as fixing some RSS downloading crashes, we have added multiple fixes for when for some reason your runtime download has not been set as active</li>",
      "\t<li>If feed errors occur, GMS2 will still look for the matching runtime in your download folder, but will now more reliably activate it and allow the IDE to start up correctly</li>",
      "\t<li>Additionally, as of this release, if you do not have the correct matching runtime in your install, but you do have an older one, then GMS2 will activate that one just so it can start up safely (and then prompt you to update)</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Changes To Build Tools So In-Game Sprites Now Use QOI Image Format</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>See the runtime notes for more information, but games now use a modified version of the QOI image format with BZ2 compression, which is smaller than PNG (we saw in our testing that game packages are now around 80% of the size they would be in 2.3.7) and quicker to decompress</li>",
      "\t<li>You should also see your project build times are quite a bit shorter in this release (again, we saw potentially around 50% quicker, but quite how much depends on the size of your project and the number of sprites, obviously)</li>",
      "\t<li>If for some reason your game now fails to build or takes noticeably longer than 2.3.7 requires, please let us know via a bug report ticket and remember to attach a download of your project so we can check why it has an issue</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Added the Room Layer Inspector</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>When in the Room Editor you can now open the Inspector and make changes to the properties of your room layers</li>",
      "\t<li>Using this new Inspector functionality you can control whether a room layer has a single-layer effect applied to it</li>",
      "\t<li>Note that this is a \"phase 1\" implementation and so not all settings for all layer types are inspectable - more will be enabled in future releases</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Added more into the Room Instance Inspector</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Implemented support for editing Instance Variables and also Inheritance values</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Added A Game Option For Compatibility Collision Calculations</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>See the runtime notes and <a href=\"https://manual.yoyogames.com/#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FMovement_And_Collisions%2FCollisions%2FCollision_Compatibility_Mode.htm\" target=\"_blank\">its page in the manual</a> for more information, but bounding boxes have changed as of this release to be floats rather than ints, so that we could fix a number of longstanding bugs with testing collisions against rotated/scaled sprites</li>",
      "    \t<li>Accordingly, there is a new setting in Game Options > Main which tells the runner to maintain the old calculations, so that existing projects which show problems with the new collision calculations going forward can maintain the old way and not require refactoring</li>",
      "    \t<li>Note that we would recommend going forward that you use the newer float bounding box calculations system and generate your sprites and code accordingly, rather than always ticking this option in new projects</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Added Preference \"Never Enable Laptop Mode\"</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Now there is a toggle to turn Laptop Mode off permanently if you wish (previously, this was automatically enabled each startup)</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Added the Font Inspector</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Implemented support for editing your fonts in the Inspector</li>",
      "\t<li>Also introduces a new design for the glyph range selection dialog</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Removed the Remote Worker</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Whilst there are a small number of worker users and so we appreciate this might affect your workflow, the usage levels are so low that continuing to ship the installer as part of the download to everyone and support the worker each release is not effective</li>",
      "\t<li>Please use the regular Windows and Mac IDEs for all your platform builds now</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Tweaked the renderer's memory-management</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Should resolve a number of poor performance issues and graphics card memory crashes seen in the last couple of releases</li>",
      "\t<li>If you do still have issues, please file a bug report, but remember to attach your ui.log and a DXDiag/System Information report</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Misc Tweaks To UI Functionality</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>You can now double-click any device name in Target Manager to open Device manager and edit it - you now don't have to click the pencil button every time</li>",
      "\t<li>Added new \"Show/Close All Windows\" entries to the Layouts section of the menu bar, so these are no longer only on the Workspace right-click context menu</li>",
      "\t<li>Go To was disabled when on the Start Page in 2.3.7 in order to stop a crash, but this has been refined so that Go To is now re-enabled when on the Start Page but it will only search inside Preferences</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Misc Important Changes To Be Aware Of</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: GMS2 will now set an Android appcompat library version suited to the compile SDK value you used (which handles changes in newer SDKs/NDKs to require newer tools now)</li>",
      "\t<li>Marketplace/Local Package Integration: Packages downloaded to a Dropbox folder and imported whilst Dropbox is running will no longer give a \"Failed to verify the package\" error</li>",
      "\t<li>Note: this one is actually because Dropbox is quietly adding a “.device” file into your downloads - our fix is simply to ignore this file, but you may wish to review any files you have downloaded already</li>",
      "\t<li>Project Export: GMS2 no longer goes unstable when exporting projects containing lots of extensions [GMS2 no longer creates one subst drive per extension, instead it creates one temp drive and reuses it for all]</li>",
      "\t<li>Fixed a rare startup crash when the renderer cannot determine your graphics card, however be aware that whilst this might allow GMS2 to start you may then get other errors - should you find your ui.log says your GPU drivers are \"null\", can you reinstall your GPU driver and then file a bug ticket if that does not fix it (telling us what graphics chip model and driver version you are actually using)</li>",
      "\t<li>Startup: [Mac IDE] No longer crashes immediately when using Mojave</li>",
      "\t<li>Note: A couple of tickets suggest newer macOS versions would show the same issue if you're actually using old Mac hardware which Apple do not themselves support in that OS, but you had turned off SIP and installed anyway</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Other Bugs Fixed</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser:Folders no longer collapse\\expand themselves on adding\\deleting\\duplicating an asset when a filter is active</li>",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: [Mac IDE] GMS2 no longer goes unstable when canceling the conversion of a 2.2.5 project which contains an asset you are currently performing Add Existing on</li>",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: Creating assets via hotkey immediately after deleting a folder now safely adds the new asset into the asset browser root level (which also stops an error on reloading that project later)</li>",
      "\t<li>AnimCurve Editor: Ctrl+Mousewheel now zooms to a point centered on the mouse pointer</li>",
      "\t<li>AnimCurve Editor: You can now duplicate a channel via the context menu and via hotkey</li>",
      "\t<li>AnimCurve Editor: The first point in your curve is now correctly affected by undo (all the other points where already working correctly in 2.3.7) and we also fixed that attempting an Undo in the curve editor could cause rendering issues</li>",
      "\t<li>AnimCurve Editor: \"Toggle Visibility\" button’s highlight is now fixed</li>",
      " \t<li>Building Projects: Fixed a method of \"Unable to obtain permission to execute\" errors shown to some users who have valid licences</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: A sequence calling an audio file no longer shows \"going to assume it's AudioKeyframe\" warnings</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Fixed a general issue where having an empty value for any required \"Platform Settings\" Preference could show an Igor error in your compiler log</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: Structs using variables names which match existing asset names will no longer fail your compile</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: Macros containing function declarations no longer throw a compile error</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: Code such as \"MyStruct().a++;\" no longer gives unexpected compiler errors</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Splash screen images only worked on some platforms if a genuine .png file was supplied in Game Options (rather than, for example, a JPEG format file simply renamed “.png”), so the build tools will now detect the mismatch and convert the image for you</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: [YYC] The error message used for when your Visual Studio install directory cannot be found has now been made easier to understand and therefore fix, as GMS2 will now catch this issue and direct you to fix your Preferences value</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [YYC] Calling variable_struct_remove() on a \"global\" struct no longer causes build errors</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: [macOS] Mac IDE now takes less time to build projects which contain many Included Files - much closer to what the Windows IDE requires</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: [OperaGX] Builds no longer fail if the project is called specifically \"game\"</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [OperaGX] Package uploading will now inform you and stop the upload when your package’s file size is too large [The UI also now shows all the values in MB rather than bytes, so is easier to understand]</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: [macOS YYC] Steam builds no longer crash on launch because the correct Steam app ID is now used</li>",
      "   \t<li>Building Projects: [macOS] Devs were unable to determine themselves the cause of \"System.Exception: could not find archive\" errors as not enough compiler log information</li>",
      "    \t<li>Note: The above was a genuine fail for a bad package name, not a bug, but we have now restored a reasonable amount of Xcode's output into the compiler log, which will help determine reasons for errors such as this</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: Updated all Android tool chain path checks to match folder structure changes in NDK 23+ installs</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Ctrl+Tab to switch to fullscreen code editor tabs now also activates the caret inside the editor, so you can now start typing immediately</li>",
      "\t<li>A matching change has been made for when clicking on a \"code workspace\" tab containing multiple tabs to set focus to the active script tab (which also then works with Go To navigation changes also)</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Unsaved changes asterisk indicator on script tabs no longer incorrectly returns if the GMS2 window loses focus shortly after a save operation</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: angle_difference() auto-complete shows its argument descriptions in the correct order now</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (DND): Undo and Redo menubar items and hotkeys now work correctly after making changes to DnD nodes</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (DnD): \"Do Effect\" node's alpha option was redundant and so has been removed</li>",
      "\t<li>Config Editor: Deleting a parent config now warns you that all of its children will be deleted as well</li>",
      "\t<li>Debugger: Boolean values can now be edited again [also fixed the formatting to be lowercase \"true\" and \"false\" to match the in-game format]</li>",
      "\t<li>Debugger: Fixed issue where trying to edit array values in the Locals window always failed, even though the same array could be edited successfully in the Watches window</li>",
      "\t<li>Debugger: Built-in variable 'sequence_instance' now appears in the Locals window</li>",
      "\t<li>Font Editor/Inspector: Changed \"From File\" to be consistent between the editor and the inspector and so that both methods allow the use of .txt and .csv files with no issues, plus to accept other formats but in those cases to warn that the results may not be as expected</li>",
      "\t<li>Font Editor: Fixed an issue where Select Font occasionally could not be undone</li>",
      "\t<li>General: [Ubuntu and Mac IDEs] GMS2 no longer has a silent exception in Graphics.VertexBuffer.Destroy() when closing down</li>",
      "\t<li>Go To: Redefine Keys preferences results no longer show up when you have \"Search in Preferences\" disabled</li>",
      "\t<li>Go To: We also fixed misc issues which meant that several buttons throughout the IDE were previously not being included in the search results</li>",
      "\t<li>Image Editor: Copying 256-colour image data from outside GMS2 and pasting it in no longer flips the red/blue values</li>",
      "\t<li>Image Editor: CTRL+D now works for duplicating layers</li>",
      "\t<li>Image Editor: \"Convert To Frames\" command no longer requires two attempts to succeed</li>",

      "\t<li>Image Editor: \"Rotate brush 90 degrees\" shortcut key now works again</li>\t",
      "\t<li>Image Editor: Undoing a resize by \"Resize All Frames\" now undoes the changes to height and width properly</li>",
      "\t<li>Game Options: [Opera GX] Cursors can now be made visible on game start, as a Game Option to enable the cursor was previously missing (you will need to select this option to get the fix)</li>",
      "\t<li>Install: [Windows IDE] If you requested the installer make one, the Windows desktop shortcut's \"Start in\" value is no longer set to an invalid path (seems to have only ever affected a tiny number of users)</li>",
      "\t<li>Inspector: [Font] Glyph Section buttons no longer remain selected after clearing selection</li>",
      "\t<li>Inspector: [Room/Sequences] Asset previews now update when changing frames in an instance (fixed both sprites on asset layers and objects on instance layers)</li>",
      "\t<li>Inspector: \"Disable IDE transition animations\" Preference is now obeyed by Inspectors</li>",
      "\t<li>Licensing: GMS2 no longer crashes when clicking Log Out if your user data folder and um.json file were already deleted by you whilst GMS2 was still open</li>",
      "\t<li>Object Editor: 'Add child' in Parent options is now correctly affected by attempts to undo changes</li>",
      "\t<li>Preferences: UWP pref for remembering the package type is no longer valid and has been removed (which also removes a bug reported that this setting reverted itself when Create EXE was performed)</li>",
      "\t<li>Preferences: [Mac IDE] Generating an Android keystore File now works correct on Macs with M1 CPUs (ones with Intel CPUs, it already worked fine in previous GMS2 releases)</li>",
      "\t<li>Preferences: Android's platform settings no longer has several text labels clipped at certain DPI values</li>",
      "\t<li>Preferences: \"Auto Logout\" isn't functioning correctly for one Edu customer [we added more logging for this, rather than a true fix, so if you are affected by this issue also, then please file a bug report and send your ui.log]</li>",
      "\t<li>Project Load: Fixed issues where importing old-format tutorial projects no longer imported their Included Files or other required source image/sound files</li>",

      "\t<li>Project Save: Dragging a file onto GMS2 to add as an Included File no longer has the potential to stop all further save attempts in that session</li>",
      "\t<li>Redefine Keys: Timeline Editor's \"Edit Moment\" hotkey of Alt+Enter now works again [the same thing would have affected any key combination which used Enter/Return along with any other keys]</li>",
      "\t<li>Redefine Keys: Timeline Editor's \"Edit Moment\" preference label is now \"Change Moment\" to match the actual editor command</li>",
      "\t<li>Redefine Keys: Fixed an issue with keybindings not working correctly for some commands which had multiple keys available to do the same thing, or where the timings of the keypresses could affect the outcome (e.g., a very quick press-and-release of Ctrl+Tab would give a different result to holding those keys for a tiny amount longer)</li>",

      "\t<li>Startup: GMS2 no longer crashes on receiving http error \"(417) Expectation Failed.\" from a proxy server stopping a user from logging-in (you will still need to resolve your proxy server issue, but this fix means GMS2 remains stable and tells you about the problem)</li>",
      "\t<li>Start Page: User's name shown no longer differs if using YYAcc or Opera SSO to login (it always shows your Username if you have set one in your YoYo Account panel or otherwise your first name)</li>",

      "\t<li>UI/UX: Light Skin's window close button no longer has an unwanted extra \"X\" embedded in the image, so now looks cleaner</li>",
      "\t<li>Undo: You can now undo renaming an asset in the Asset Browser even after you have clicked off it and therefore “confirmed” that change</li>",

      "\t<li>Fixed a rare startup crash when the renderer cannot determine your graphics card, however be aware that whilst this might allow GMS2 to start you may then get other errors - should you find your ui.log says your GPU drivers are \"null\", can you reinstall your GPU driver and then file a bug ticket if that does not fix it (telling us what graphics chip model and driver version you are actually using)</li>",
      "\t<li>Startup: [Mac IDE] No longer crashes immediately when using Mojave</li>",

      "    <li>Fixed various bugs with Non-Microsoft IMEs not giving the expected results when typing in the Windows IDE (such as Baidu and others)</li>",
      "    <li>If you use an IME it would be great to get your feedback on whether this version is better for you now and if any major issues still exist</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Added A Toggle For If Arrays Should Copy-On-Write</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>There is a new game option for whether your games should continue to copy arrays when writing to them or not, which may give performance/memory improvements in your games</li>",
      "\t<li>Note that when opening/importing existing projects this will default to being enabled (maintaining the old behaviour of doing the copy) and for new projects this will default to off (the new behaviour of not copying)</li>",

      "\t<li>Be aware, though, that this actually sets <i>col</i> using the correct format for GMS2 (which is $AABBGGRR, while CSS colours are in the form #RRGGBB), so the debugger and elsewhere in GMS2 will show <i>col</i> as $00FFF8F0 (or 16775408 in decimal) rather than the #F0F8FF you might have expected</li>",

      "\t<li>Removed the old code inside the runner for all Steam functions (which relied on a very old Steamworks SDK), in favour of a new extension which can be updated more easily in future</li>",
      "\t<li>This means that your games do not always ship with Steam built-in now, regardless of whether you were using it or not</li>",
      "\t<li>For this reason, many of the IDE settings for enabling and configuring Steamworks are now gone, in favour of you editing these values inside the extension once it is added to your project</li>",

      "\t<li>This will allow the quality of the translations to improve and also for more of the product to be localised, plus for the translations to arrive more quickly after a new feature has been added</li>",

      "\t<li>A number of UX and UI improvements have been implemented on the Start Page, so things have moved around slightly (see below for specifics)</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Splash screen images would only work in previous versions if it was a genuine .png file you supplied in Game Options (as opposed to some other format, but renamed “.png”); however, GMS2 will now detect a mismatch and convert incorrect file types</li>",

      "<h2>Changes Since 2022.2.0</h2>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>Project Load: Added a \"This project is being opened Read-Only\" message for whenever the project being opened requires this protection because it's too new for the IDE you're using</li>",
      "\t<li>This dialog also links to <a href=\"https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/4518066618129\" target=\"_blank\"> a Helpdesk guide about how you can edit your project</a> so it will open in the older version (if you actually need to stick with the old IDE for some reason)</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "",
      "",
      "<h2>2022.2.0</h2>",
      "<h3>Added Text Tracks In Sequences</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>You can now add text tracks/instances into your sequences by clicking the \"T\" text tool in the canvas toolbox, edit the text via the new text layer inspector (which will open automatically when creating a new text item in your sequence) and animate it via the dope sheet, then draw it in-game later on</li>",
      "\t<li>Note that at this time there is no ability to later override the contents of the text in-game, but this will come sometime in the future</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Updated SDL2 Version To Fix Various UI/UX Issues</h3>",
      "<ul>\t",
      "    <li>Fixed various bugs with Non-Microsoft IMEs not giving the expected results when typing in the Windows IDE (such as Baidu and others)</li>",
      "    <li>If you use an IME it would be great to get your feedback on whether this version is better for you now and if any major issues still exist</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Added A Toggle For If Arrays Should Copy-On-Write</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>There is a new game option for whether your games should continue to copy arrays when writing to them or not, which may give performance/memory improvements in your games</li>",
      "\t<li>Note that when opening/importing existing projects this will default to being enabled (maintaining the old behaviour of doing the copy) and for new projects this will default to off (the new behaviour of not copying)</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Added Support For Defining In-Game Colours Using CSS Values</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>You can now insert <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp\" target=\"_blank\">CSS colours</a> into your GML code by using a '#' symbol followed by 6 digit hex code - e.g., <i>var col = #F0F8FF; // AliceBlue</i></li>",
      "\t<li>Be aware, though, that this actually sets <i>col</i> using the correct format for GMS2 (which is $AABBGGRR, while CSS colours are in the form #RRGGBB), so the debugger and elsewhere in GMS2 will show <i>col</i> as $00FFF8F0 (or 16775408 in decimal) rather than the #F0F8FF you might have expected</li>",
      "\t<li>Note that this format is usable any place where a number can be used, as GML colours are just numbers, so these hex values can be used in more places than just defining a colour</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>New Functionality Within Xbox Builds</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Game Options for the GDK target now has a new checkbox for enabling “Simplified User Model” functionality (defaults to off), which will then toggle the user model in your games</li>",
      "\t<li>Game Options labels for the Xbox stat-system names have been reworded to match Microsoft’s current naming conventions, plus the settings have been expanded to allow mixing systems (again, to match what Microsoft allowed nowadays)</li>",
      "\t<li>Please see the Xbox docs for more information</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Removed In-Built Steamworks Functions</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Removed the old code inside the runner for all Steam functions (which relied on a very old Steamworks SDK), in favour of a new extension which can be updated more easily in future</li>",
      "\t<li>This means that your games do not always ship with Steam built-in now, regardless of whether you were using it or not</li>",
      "\t<li>For this reason, many of the IDE settings for enabling and configuring Steamworks are now gone, in favour of you editing these values inside the extension once it is added to your project</li>",
      "\t<li>The new Steamworks extension will be added to the Marketplace soon - again, to be clear: you <b>will</b> require this extension in your project and to configure some of its setup values if you want to enable Steam in your projects going forward</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Refinement Of The IDE Translations Process</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>You should not see any negative impact from this change - however, be aware that the tools used to generate translations are being changed and also we are performing clean-up on several of the language .csv files</li>",
      "\t<li>This will allow the quality of the translations to improve and also for more of the product to be localised, plus for the translations to arrive more quickly after a new feature has been added</li>",
      "\t<li>If you do see any issues in your chosen translation, please do file a bug report for this</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Misc Important Changes To Be Aware Of</h3>",
      "<ul>\t",
      "\t<li>There is an important fix for making login sessions be one for the host machine instead of one per-IDE install on that machine, so you should see this behave properly now</li>",
      "\t<li>Windows x64 support is now enabled by default when creating any new projects and so will be the output package you get from a Create Exe (you can disable it again in Game Options > Windows should you need to)</li>",
      "\t<li>Fixed a few issues with dodgy/slow internet and uploading games to Opera GXC (the dialog also now tells you if your package size is over the limit, as well as various other UI/UX improvements)</li>",
      "\t<li>A number of UX and UI improvements have been implemented on the Start Page, so things have moved around slightly (see below for specifics)</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Splash screen images would only work in previous versions if it was a genuine .png file you supplied in Game Options (as opposed to some other format, but renamed “.png”); however, GMS2 will now detect a mismatch and convert incorrect file types</li>",
      "</ul>",

      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Lots and lots of project conversion issues have been fixed (and a number of you have recieved fixed copies of your projects already, so they're not listed below), however the vast majority were due to one of the following four reasons:</li>",
      "\t<li>The default texture/audio groups disappearing from the old project during the conversion process (the same issue which was affecting our own tutorials)</li>",
      "\t<li>Corrupt views referencing resources multiple times (so the project may have had issues in 2.2.5, saying it couldn't find files, etc.)</li>",
      "\t<li>DnD Scripts referencing multiple resources in unhandled ways</li>",
      "\t<li>Amazon's Game Options not upgrading properly from very old values to current ones</li>",
      "\t<li>If your project previously failed to convert in 2.3.0 and we haven't already sent you a fixed copy, please try it again now. If it still fails, then please file a bug ticket and send us the original .yyz/.zip copy of the project (give us a download URL if the project is larger than 20MB)</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Bezier Curves</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Added a new curve type in the Curve Editor = Beziers allow you to ease in/out of curve points and fine-tune your animations</li>",
      "\t<li>Also made a number of improvements to manipulating curves used as position tracks on the Sequence Editor canvas - such as live preview/updating of the canvas area as you modify your curves and the ability to modify your bezier handles on the canvas itself</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Dopesheet Curve Editor</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Further improving curve-editing, you can now edit your embedded curves right in the dopesheet within the Sequence Editor - toggle to the curve editing mode and make your changes to see the canvas update</li>",
      "\t<li>Added a \"Height of Anim Curve Track in Dopesheet\" Preference so you can choose whether you want your curves to be double-height in the Dopesheet</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Snappable Dopesheet</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>And finally for curve-editing and the Sequence Editor, you can also now snap the Dopesheet to the top, bottom, left or right edges of the Sequence Editor ...or you can pop it out into its own floating window!</li>",
      "\t<li>Closing or \"resetting\" a floating Dopesheet will restore it back to the default (bottom) snap</li>",
      "\t<li>Each Sequence has its own snap/floating setting so that you can do things like float the dopesheet for one sequence and see it alongside the dopesheet for another</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Sprite Broadcast Messages</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>2.3.0 added the ability for a sequence track to fire off Broadcast Messages, and now 2.3.1 brings the same functionality to all sprites</li>",
      "\t<li>You add the message as a moment on the Sprite Editor timeline, and then this fires in-game when that frame is reached</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Room Manager Tools</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>The Room Manager window has now been extended so you can more easily move your rooms around when you have lots of them you need to manage - some UI tweaks, new send to top/bottom buttons, plus the ability to add groups</li>",
      "\t<li>Note that grouping the rooms has no effect on their order - this is still always performed top-to-bottom</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Multiple new package formats have been added</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Windows x64 runner support (toggled via Game Options > Windows)</li>",
      "\t<li>ARM packages for Ubuntu (GMS2 works this out dynamically depending on the architecture of the device your targeting that build)</li>",
      "\t<li>UWP multiple architectures in one package (now part of the Create Exe button process)</li>",
      "\t<li>Should you have one, you will also find GMS2 itself and macOS games now run fine on your Apple Silicon developer-testing Mac</li>",
      "\t<li>If you have issues with your projects running fine in the \"regular\" versions of any of these but in the \"new\" versions they are incorrect, then please do file a bug ticket and send us the .yyz/.zip copy of the project (give us a download URL if the project is larger than 20MB)</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Misc Other Changes</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Changed the code-folding on { to be on the function line always, so that you don't get a dangling { as in 2.3.0 - also added a Preference to disable code-folding on ( for those who only want to fold via regions</li>",
      "\t<li>Added a new Preference for whether you want changing the filtering of the asset browser to immediately re-expanded the groups or not (that the asset browser always expanded all groups each time you created an asset while the filter is active has been fixed)</li>",
      "\t<li>Have had to slightly change the Mac IDE keys for managing Bookmarks, as the old ones clashed with macOS hotkeys and so caused issues - setting a bookmark is now CMD+CTRL+[0-9] and jumping back to it later is CMD+[0-9]</li>",
      "\t<li>Within the Sequence Editor, you can now create Moment functions using the name you set in the text box, rather than having to create and then rename</li>",
      "\t<li>Added a Preference to edit the boiler plate comment shown at the top of a new Script Resource (or to turn it off if you want)</li>",
      "\t<li>Added a timeout to debugger connections - so now GMS2 will abort the build and show a \"Are you perhaps firewalled?\" if the debugger takes too long, rather than waiting indefinitely</li>",
      "\t<li>File > My Account whill now use your default browser, rather than opening a browser workspace tab inside GMS2</li>",
      "\t<li>Lots of missing translations for 2.3.0 features have now been added - note that at this time the 2.3.1 additions are not translated</li>",
      "\t<li>Added a new accessor for structs - $  (Which does mean if you have existing code for assigning HEX values to a variable then make sure you haven't wrapped this in []s, as this would cause a compile error now)</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Bugs Fixed</h3>",

      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Bezier Curves</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Added a new curve type in the Curve Editor = Beziers allow you to ease in/out of curve points and fine-tune your animations</li>",
      "\t<li>Also made a number of improvements to manipulating curves used as position tracks on the Sequence Editor canvas - such as live preview/updating of the canvas area as you modify your curves and the ability to modify your bezier handles on the canvas itself</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Dopesheet Curve Editor</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Further improving curve-editing, you can now edit your embedded curves right in the dopesheet within the Sequence Editor - toggle to the curve editing mode and make your changes to see the canvas update</li>",
      "\t<li>Added a \"Height of Anim Curve Track in Dopesheet\" Preference so you can choose whether you want your curves to be double-height in the Dopesheet</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Snappable Dopesheet</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>And finally for curve-editing and the Sequence Editor, you can also now snap the Dopesheet to the top, bottom, left or right edges of the Sequence Editor ...or you can pop it out into its own floating window!</li>",
      "\t<li>Closing or \"resetting\" a floating Dopesheet will restore it back to the default (bottom) snap</li>",
      "\t<li>Each Sequence has its own snap/floating setting so that you can do things like float the dopesheet for one sequence and see it alongside the dopesheet for another</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Sprite Broadcast Messages</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>2.3.0 added the ability for a sequence track to fire off Broadcast Messages, and now 2.3.1 brings the same functionality to all sprites</li>",
      "\t<li>You add the message as a moment on the Sprite Editor timeline, and then this fires in-game when that frame is reached</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Room Manager Tools</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>The Room Manager window has now been extended so you can more easily move your rooms around when you have lots of them you need to manage - some UI tweaks, new send to top/bottom buttons, plus the ability to add groups</li>",
      "\t<li>Note that grouping the rooms has no effect on their order - this is still always performed top-to-bottom</li>",

      "\t<li>Windows x64 runner support (toggled via Game Options > Windows)</li>",
      "\t<li>ARMv7 packages for Ubuntu (GMS2 works this out dynamically depending on the architecture of the device your targeting that build)</li>",
      "\t<li>UWP multiple architectures in one package (now part of the Create Exe button process)</li>",
      "\t<li>Should you have one, you will also find GMS2 itself and macOS games now run fine on your Apple Silicon developer-testing Mac</li>",
      "\t<li>If you have issues with your projects running fine in the \"regular\" versions of any of these but in the \"new\" versions they are incorrect, then please do file a bug ticket and send us the .yyz/.zip copy of the project (give us a download URL if the project is larger than 20MB)</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Misc Other Changes</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Changed the code-folding on { to be on the function line always, so that you don't get a dangling { as in 2.3.0 - also added a Preference to disable code-folding on { for those who only want to fold via regions</li>",
      "\t<li>Added a new Preference for whether you want changing the filtering of the asset browser to immediately re-expanded the groups or not (that the asset browser always expanded all groups each time you created an asset while the filter is active has been fixed)</li>",
      "\t<li>Have had to slightly change the Mac IDE keys for managing Bookmarks, as the old ones clashed with macOS hotkeys and so caused issues - setting a bookmark is now CMD+CTRL+[0-9] and jumping back to it later is CMD+[0-9]</li>",
      "\t<li>Within the Sequence Editor, you can now create Moment functions using the name you set in the text box, rather than having to create and then rename</li>",
      "\t<li>Added a Preference to edit the boiler plate comment shown at the top of a new Script Resource (or to turn it off if you want)</li>",
      "\t<li>Added a timeout to debugger connections - so now GMS2 will abort the build and show a \"Are you perhaps firewalled?\" if the debugger takes too long, rather than waiting indefinitely</li>",
      "\t<li>File > My Account whill now use your default browser, rather than opening a browser workspace tab inside GMS2</li>",
      "\t<li>Lots of missing translations for 2.3.0 features have now been added - note that at this time the 2.3.1 additions are not translated</li>",
      "\t<li>Added a new accessor for structs - $  (Which does mean if you have existing code for assigning HEX values to a variable then make sure you haven't wrapped this in []s, as this would cause a compile error now)</li>",
      "</ul>",

      "<h3>Misc Other Changes</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Changed the code-folding on { to be on the function line always, so that you don't get a dangling { as in 2.3.0 - also added a Preference to disable code-folding on { for those who only want to fold via regions</li>",
      "\t<li>Added a new Preference for whether you want changing the filtering of the asset browser to immediately re-expanded the groups or not (that the asset browser always expanded all groups each time you created an asset while the filter is active has been fixed)</li>",
      "\t<li>Have had to slightly change the Mac IDE keys for managing Bookmarks, as the old ones clashed with macOS hotkeys and so caused issues - setting a bookmark is now CMD+CTRL+[0-9] and jumping back to it later is CMD+[0-9]</li>",
      "\t<li>Within the Sequence Editor, you can now create Moment functions using the name you set in the text box, rather than having to create and then rename</li>",
      "\t<li>Added a Preference to edit the boiler plate comment shown at the top of a new Script Resource (or to turn it off if you want)</li>",
      "\t<li>Added a timeout to debugger connections - so now GMS2 will abort the build and show a \"Are you perhaps firewalled?\" if the debugger takes too long, rather than waiting indefinitely</li>",
      "\t<li>File > My Account whill now use your default browser, rather than opening a browser workspace tab inside GMS2</li>",
      "\t<li>Lots of missing translations for 2.3.0 features have now been added - note that at this time the 2.3.1 additions are not translated</li>",
      "\t<li>Added a new accessor for structs - $  (Which does mean if you have existing code for assigning HEX values to a variable then make sure you haven't wrapped this in []s, as this would cause a compile error now)</li>",

      "\t<li>Lots and lots of project conversion issues have been fixed (and a number of you have recieved fixed copies of your projects already, so they're not listed below), however the vast majority were due to one of the following four reasons:</li>",

If it still fails, then please file a bug ticket and send us the original .yyz/.zip copy of the project (give us a download URL if the project is larger than 20MB)</li>",

      "<h3>Bezier Curves</h3>",

      "\t<li>Also made a number of improvements to manipulating curves used as position tracks on the Sequence Editor canvas - such as live preview/updating of the canvas area as you modify your curves and the ability to modify your bezier handles on the canvas itself</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Dopesheet Curve Editor</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Further improving curve-editing, you can now edit your embedded curves right in the dopesheet within the Sequence Editor - toggle to the curve editing mode and make your changes to see the canvas update</li>",
      "\t<li>Added a \"Height of Anim Curve Track in Dopesheet\" Preference so you can choose whether you want your curves to be double-height in the Dopesheet</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Snappable Dopesheet</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>And finally for curve-editing and the Sequence Editor, you can also now snap the Dopesheet to the top, bottom, left or right edges of the Sequence Editor ...or you can pop it out into its own floating window!</li>",
      "\t<li>Closing or \"resetting\" a floating Dopesheet will restore it back to the default (bottom) snap</li>",

      "<h3>Misc Other Changes</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Changed the code-folding on { to be on the function line always, so that you don't get a dangling { as in 2.3.0 - also added a Preference to disable code-folding on { for those who only want to fold via regions</li>",
      "\t<li>Added a new Preference for whether you want changing the filtering of the asset browser to immediately re-expanded the groups or not (that the asset browser always expanded all groups each time you created an asset while the filter is active has been fixed)</li>",
      "\t<li>Have had to slightly change the Mac IDE keys for managing Bookmarks, as the old ones clashed with macOS hotkeys and so caused issues - setting a bookmark is now CMD+CTRL+[0-9] and jumping back to it later is CMD+[0-9]</li>",
      "\t<li>Within the Sequence Editor, you can now create Moment functions using the name you set in the text box, rather than having to create and then rename</li>",
      "\t<li>Added a Preference to edit the boiler plate comment shown at the top of a new Script Resource (or to turn it off if you want)</li>",

      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Lots and lots of project conversion issues have been fixed (and a number of you have recieved fixed copies of your projects already, so they're not listed below), however the vast majority were due to one of the following four reasons:</li>",
      "\t<li>1) The default texture/audio groups disappearing from the old project during the conversion process (the same issue which was affecting our own tutorials)</li>",
      "\t<li>2) Corrupt views referencing resources multiple times (so the project may have had issues in 2.2.5, saying it couldn't find files, etc.)</li>",
      "\t<li>3) DnD Scripts referencing multiple resources in unhandled ways</li>",
      "\t<li>4) Amazon's Game Options not upgrading properly from very old values to current ones</li>",
      "\t<li>If your project previously failed to convert in 2.3.0 (and we haven't already sent you a fixed copy), please try it again now. If it still fails, then please file a bug ticket and send us the project .yyz/.zip</li>",

      "<h3>Bezier Curves</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Added a new curve type in the Curve Editor - Beziers allow you to ease in/out of curve points and fine-tune your animations</li>",
      "\t<li>Also made a number of improvements to manipulating curves used as position tracks on the Sequence Editor canvas - such as live preview/updating of the canvas area as you modify your curves and the ability to modify your bezier handles on the canvas itself</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Dopesheet Curve Editor</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Further improving curve-editing, you can now edit your embedded curves right in the dopesheet within the Sequence Editor - toggle to the curve editing mode and make your changes to see the canvas update</li>",
      "\t<li>Added a \"Height of Anim Curve Track in Dopesheet\" Preference so you can choose whether you want your curves to be double-height in the Dopesheet</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Snappable Dopesheet</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>And finally for curve-editing and the Sequence Editor, you can also now snap the Dopesheet to the top, bottom, left or right edges of the Sequence Editor ...or you can pop it out into its own floating window</li>",
      "\t<li>Closing or \"resetting\" a floating Dopesheet will restore it back to the default (bottom) snap</li>",
      "\t<li>Each Sequence has its own snap/floating setting so that you can do things like float the dopesheet for one sequence and see it alongside the dopesheet for another</li>",

      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Changed the default sorting method used when importing a project to be Custom, so the Asset Browser order matches how the project looked before</li>",
      "\t<li>Changed the code-folding on { to be on the function line always, so that you don't get a dangling { as in 2.3.0 - also added a Preference to disable code-folding on { for those who only want to fold via regions</li>",
      "\t<li>Added a new Preference for whether you want changing the filtering of the asset browser to immediately re-expanded the groups or not (that the asset browser always expanded all groups each time you created an asset while the filter is active has been fixed)</li>",
      "\t<li>Have had to slightly change the Mac IDE keys for managing Bookmarks, as the old ones clashed with macOS hotkeys and so caused issues - setting a bookmark is now CMD+CTRL+[0-9] and jumping back to it later is CMD+[0-9]</li>",
      "\t<li>Within the Sequence Editor, you can now create Moment functions using the name you set in the text box, rather than having to create and then rename</li>",
      "\t<li>Added a Preference to edit the boiler plate comment shown at the top of a new Script Resource (or to turn it off if you want)</li>",
      "\t<li>Added a timeout to debugger connections - so now GMS2 will abort the build and show a \"Are you perhaps firewalled?\" if the debugger takes too long, rather than waiting indefinitely</li>",
      "\t<li>File > My Account will now use your default browser, rather than opening a browser workspace tab inside GMS2</li>",
      "\t<li>Lots of missing translations for 2.3.0 features have now been added, along with the translations for the new stuff in 2.3.1</li>",
      "\t<li>Added the $ symbol as a new accessor for structs (Which does mean if you have existing code for assigning HEX values to a variable then make sure you haven't wrapped this hex value in []s, as this would cause a compile error now)</li>",
      "\t<li>Removed some redundant arguments from buffer_get_surface(), so you will need to refactor any code using this function</li>",

      "<p>For more info on some of the big additions listed below, please see our <a href=\"https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017600717\" target=\"_blank\">\"What's new in 2.3.2\"</a> Helpdesk post</p>",
      "",
      "<h3>Nine Slice Support</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Nine Slices allow you to scale your sprites to stretch in a more controllable and smarter way, by keeping your corners at a fixed scale and stretching the bits in-between</li>",
      "\t<li>The Sprite Editor has a new Nine Slice panel where you can now enable this, and of course this new capability carries through into your game, where you can later manipulate the sprite at runtime should you wish</li>",
      "\t<li>Introduces the new functions sprite_nineslice_create(), sprite_set_nineslice() and sprite_get_nineslice(), as well as a number of in-built variables</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>AnimCurve Library</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>We have added a new library of preset curve types you can apply to your Bezier curves to automatically add points or change ease in/out values and easily add effects like \"bounce\" or \"elastic\"</li>",
      "\t<li>Presets can be applied to a whole curve or between selected points only</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Mac DMG Export Package</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>If you are not building for the App Store, then when you click the Create Exe button now you will be given the choice of wrapping your new app in a .zip (as always) or a .dmg installer</li>",
      "\t<li>A new Game Option has been added to control the dmg installer's background image, and it will reuse the same icon as the game app uses</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Optimisations to Reduce Project Build Times</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>We have made a number of fixes and changes to the build processes on all platforms in an attempt to reduce compile times, including:</li>",
      "\t<li>A fix to stop very large comments in your scripts from slowing down compiles</li>",
      "\t<li>Pre-compiled headers have been added for every platform</li>",
      "\t<li>A number of speed-ups have been made for the compiler itself</li>",
      "\t<li>Lots of fixes for cached builds actually making full use of the cache</li>",
      "\t<li>The sounds change mentioned below</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Asset Compiler Changes for Sounds</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Carrying on from the above change, we made a further optimisation for sounds:</li>",
      "\t<li>If you have any ogg files in your sounds and you have set these to remain compressed in the sound editor, these will now not be recompiled during every build and instead the original file will just be passed through to your package, as it will be assumed you have created the sound with the desired values. This speeds up builds, but also stops an issue where occasionally small amounts of silence were added to the ogg files</li>",
      "\t<li>Similarly, if you have any wav files and you have set these to remain uncompressed in the sound editor, then the asset compiler will first quickly check if the values you set in the sound editor match the contents of the .wav, and again if they already match your source .wav it will just be passed through to your package. If they do not match, then the wav will be recompiled as before</li>",
      "\t<li>Note that using a .mp3 will still always result in a recompile, as will providing an .ogg but then requesting it becomes an uncompressed sound or providing a .wav but then requesting it becomes a compressed sound</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Use Your Default Browser For Tutorials</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Continuing our drive to use external browsers for all website functionality and thereby improve usability as well as reduce the GMS2 installer size, tutorial panels will now open in your default browser outside GMS2</li>",
      "\t<li>Please be aware that we have plans to make our tutorials be actual pages on our website so we can live-update fixes and add more tutorials more easily, and so the existing tutorials will all be updated in the not-too-distant future. This means formatting issues with the current tutorials are a known issue and will be fixed asap - kindly do not submit bug reports for these</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Live Updating of the Colour Picker values</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Now, when spawning a colour picker in any applicable editor, you will be able to tweak your colours and see these apply in the main editor straight away - no more having to apply the colour change to see the update and then re-open the picker to make tweaks</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>New Sequence Playback DND Nodes</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Along with a small stack of fixes for other DND issues in this release, we have added some new nodes for controlling playback of your sequences:</li>",
      "\t<li>\"Sequence Get Length\", \"Sequence Get Head Position\", and \"Sequence Set Head Position\"</li>",
      "</ul>",

      "<h2>Beta IDE 249...</h2>",
      "",
      "<h3>Nine Slice Support</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Nine Slices allow you to scale your sprites to stretch in a more controllable and smarter way, by keeping your corners at a fixed scale and stretching the bits in-between</li>",
      "\t<li>The Sprite Editor has a new Nine Slice panel where you can now enable this, and of course this new capability carries through into your game, where you can later manipulate the sprite at runtime should you wish</li>",
      "\t<li>Introduces the new functions sprite_nineslice_create(), sprite_set_nineslice() and sprite_get_nineslice(), as well as a number of in-built variables</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>AnimCurve Library</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>We have added a new library of preset curve types you can apply to your Bezier curves to automatically add points or change ease in/out values and easily add effects like \"bounce\" or \"elastic\"</li>",
      "\t<li>Presets can be applied to a whole curve or between selected points only</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Mac DMG Export Package</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>If you are not building for the App Store, then when you click the Create Exe button now you will be given the choice of wrapping your new app in a .zip (as always) or a .dmg installer</li>",
      "\t<li>A new Game Option has been added to control the dmg installer's background image, and it will reuse the same icon as the game app uses</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Optimisations to Reduce Project Build Times</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>We have made a number of fixes and changes to the build processes on all platforms in an attempt to reduce compile times, including:</li>",
      "\t<li>A fix to stop very large comments in your scripts from slowing down compiles</li>",
      "\t<li>Pre-compiled headers have been added for every platform</li>",
      "\t<li>A number of speed-ups have been made for the compiler itself</li>",
      "\t<li>Lots of fixes for cached builds actually making full use of the cache</li>",
      "\t<li>The sounds change mentioned below</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Asset Compiler Changes for Sounds</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Carrying on from the above change, we made a further optimisation for sounds:</li>",
      "\t<li>If you have any ogg files in your sounds and you have set these to remain compressed in the sound editor, these will now not be recompiled during every build and instead the original file will just be passed through to your package, as it will be assumed you have created the sound with the desired values. This speeds up builds, but also stops an issue where occasionally small amounts of silence were added to the ogg files</li>",
      "\t<li>Similarly, if you have any wav files and you have set these to remain uncompressed in the sound editor, then the asset compiler will first quickly check if the values you set in the sound editor match the contents of the .wav, and again if they already match your source .wav it will just be passed through to your package. If they do not match, then the wav will be recompiled as before</li>",
      "\t<li>Note that using a .mp3 will still always result in a recompile, as will providing an .ogg but then requesting it becomes an uncompressed sound or providing a .wav but then requesting it becomes a compressed sound</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Use Your Default Browser For Tutorials</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Continuing our drive to use external browsers for all website functionality and thereby improve usability as well as reduce the GMS2 installer size, tutorial panels will now open in your default browser outside GMS2</li>",
      "\t<li>Please be aware that we have plans to make our tutorials be actual pages on our website so we can live-update fixes and add more tutorials more easily, and so the existing tutorials will all be updated in the not-too-distant future. This means formatting issues with the current tutorials are a known issue and will be fixed asap - kindly do not submit bug reports for these</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Live Updating of the Colour Picker values</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Now, when spawning a colour picker in any applicable editor, you will be able to tweak your colours and see these apply in the main editor straight away - no more having to apply the colour change to see the update and then re-open the picker to make tweaks</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>New Sequence Playback DND Nodes</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Along with a small stack of fixes for other DND issues in this release, we have added some new nodes for controlling playback of your sequences:</li>",
      "\t<li>\"Sequence Get Length\", \"Sequence Get Head Position\", and \"Sequence Set Head Position\"</li>",
      "</ul>",

      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Android] Implement \"On New Intent\" support (for extensions which require this)</li>",

      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Windows YYC] Output a helpful error message when builds fail because VS batch file Preference value is incorrect</li>",

      "<h3>AnimCurve Library</h3>",

      "\t<li>A fix to stop very large comments in your scripts from slowing down compiles</li>",

      "\t<li>Carrying on from the above change, we made a further optimisation for sounds:</li>",
      "\t<li>If you have any ogg files in your sounds and you have set these to remain compressed in the sound editor, these will now not be recompiled during every build and instead the original file will just be passed through to your package, as it will be assumed you have created the sound with the desired values. This speeds up builds, but also stops an issue where occasionally small amounts of silence were added to the ogg files</li>",
      "\t<li>Similarly, if you have any wav files and you have set these to remain uncompressed in the sound editor, then the asset compiler will first quickly check if the values you set in the sound editor match the contents of the .wav, and again if they already match your source .wav it will just be passed through to your package. If they do not match, then the wav will be recompiled as before</li>",
      "\t<li>Note that using a .mp3 will still always result in a recompile, as will providing an .ogg but then requesting it becomes an uncompressed sound or providing a .wav but then requesting it becomes a compressed sound</li>",

      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Continuing our drive to use external browsers for all website functionality and thereby improve usability as well as reduce the GMS2 installer size, tutorial panels will now open in your default browser outside GMS2</li>",
      "\t<li>Please be aware that we have plans to make our tutorials be actual pages on our website so we can live-update fixes and add more tutorials more easily, and so the existing tutorials will all be updated in the not-too-distant future. This means formatting issues with the current tutorials are a known issue and will be fixed asap - kindly do not submit bug reports for these</li>",

      "<h3>Live Updating of the Colour Picker values</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Now, when spawning a colour picker in any applicable editor, you will be able to tweak your colours and see these apply in the main editor straight away - no more having to apply the colour change to see the update and then re-open the picker to make tweaks</li>",

      "\t<li>If you have any ogg files in your sounds and you have set these to remain compressed in the sound editor, these will now not be recompiled during every build and instead the original file will just be passed through to your package, as it will be assumed you have created the sound with the desired values. This speeds up builds, but also stops an issue where occasionally small amounts of silence were added to the ogg files</li>",
      "\t<li>Similarly, if you have any wav files and you have set these to remain uncompressed in the sound editor, then the asset compiler will first quickly check if the values you set in the sound editor match the contents of the .wav, and again if they already match your source .wav it will just be passed through to your package. If they do not match, then the wav will be recompiled as before</li>",
      "\t<li>Note that using a .mp3 will still always result in a recompile, as will providing an .ogg but then requesting it becomes an uncompressed sound or providing a .wav but then requesting it becomes a compressed sound</li>",

This speeds up builds, but also stops an issue where occasionally small amounts of silence were added to the ogg files</li>",
      "\t<li>Similarly, if you have any wav files and you have set these to remain uncompressed in the sound editor, then the asset compiler will first quickly check if the values you set in the sound editor match the contents of the .wav, and again if they already match your source .wav it will just be passed through to your package. If they do not match, then the wav will be recompiled as before</li>",

      "\t<li>This means as soon as GMS2 is installed you can create/open projects and test them on Windows or macOS (so if you're a Trial user, then there are no further downloads required)</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Unbundled Git tools from the installer</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>GMS2 now relies on external source control tools you point to in Preferences, rather than us shipping a specific version of the Git tools</li>",
      "\t<li>This means you can point at your own installed-and-configured Git client and use its own authentication settings, etc. It also means your tools can easily be kept up-to-date with external changes by Github, etc.</li>",
      "\t<li>Note: This does mean that you will need to reconfigure your Git settings one time in Preferences before your projects are going to show as SCM-enabled!</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Implemented a new Undo system</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>All undo and redo actions have been changed to use a new per-asset history system, which brings a few benefits:</li>",
      "\t<li>It's always going to be the most recent action which is undone - e.g., in previous versions of GMS2 if you created a Sprite, resized it in the Sprite Editor, then opened it in the Image Editor and added some content, then switched focus back to the Sprite Editor and pressed Ctrl+Z it would be the resize which was undone and not any of the later changes in the Image Editor. Now, GMS2 would set focus back to the Image Editor and undo your last change there, and pressing Undo again would step back through the change history for the asset as you would expect.</li>",
      "\t<li>It's also now possible to undo a change to an asset after you have closed its editor - in previous versions of GMS2, as soon as you closed an editor your changes were final</li>",
      "\t<li>If you do see any issues with undo/redo, then please do try to determine the precise steps to recreate the issue, otherwise we may need your project to be sent also with your ticket</li>",

      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>The last couple of GMS2 releases have shown higher-than-expected CPU usage values on some machines (particularly on Windows), and this release aims to reduce that back down again</li>",
      "\t<li>In theory, you shouldn't see any issues and hopefully CPU usage values are considerably lower on your machine now - if you find your usage numbers have for some reason gone up noticeably, then please do file a ticket about this</li>",
      "\t<li>However, please be aware we have found some of our machines saw very little benefit - we're still looking into this, so please don't report tickets if CPU usage has stayed about the same for you</li>",
      "\t<li>Similarly, if your CPU values are lower now, you may realise that whilst the bottom dock / the Output Window is expanded, then CPU usage remains quite a bit higher than if the dock is collapsed - again, we are aware, so please don't report tickets for this</li> ",

      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>These are: Notes, Scripts, Sequences (and individual sequence instances - e.g., inside the Room Editor), Shaders, and Tilesets</li>",
      "\t<li>Now, if any of these are selected the Inspector will populate with many of the settings relevant to that asset/instance</li>",

      "\t<li>Room Editor: Duplicating a room now preserves its instance creation order values</li>",
      "\t<li>Room Editor: Undoing the drawing of tiles now saves this change properly, which means you won't still see the stale tiles in-game or when reopening the room</li>",
      "\t<li>Room Editor: Reordering the instance creation order list now flags the project needs to be saved, so builds will now pick up the change correctly</li>",

      "\t<li>Sound Editor: .ogg sound file previews will now reliably play from the start of the audio file each time [may actually have already been fixed for 290]</li>",
      "\t<li>Source Control: The Mac IDE cannot push to an online repository if your keychain has not already been configured with your password, etc., so when GMS2 detects this error we have added a dialog saying this and (briefly) how to fix</li>",

      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Depending on which IDE installer you downloaded, you now have the matching runtime for just that one platform included inside the installer</li>",
      "\t<li>This means as soon as GMS2 is installed you can create/open projects and test them on Windows or macOS (so if you're a Trial user, then there are no further downloads required)</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Unbundled Git tools from the installer</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>GMS2 now relies on external source control tools you point to in Preferences, rather than us shipping a specific version of the Git tools</li>",
      "\t<li>This means you can point at your own installed-and-configured Git client and use its own authentication settings, etc. It also means your tools can easily be kept up-to-date with external changes by Github, etc.</li>",
      "\t<li>Note: This does mean that you will need to reconfigure your Git settings one time in Preferences before your projects are going to show as SCM-enabled!</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Implemented a new Undo system</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>All undo and redo actions have been changed to use a new per-asset history system, which brings a few benefits:</li>",
      "\t<li>It's always going to be the most recent action which is undone - e.g., in previous versions of GMS2 if you created a Sprite, resized it in the Sprite Editor, then opened it in the Image Editor and added some content, then switched focus back to the Sprite Editor and pressed Ctrl+Z it would be the resize which was undone and not any of the later changes in the Image Editor. Now, GMS2 would set focus back to the Image Editor and undo your last change there, and pressing Undo again would step back through the change history for the asset as you would expect.</li>",
      "\t<li>It's also now possible to undo a change to an asset after you have closed its editor - in previous versions of GMS2, as soon as you closed an editor your changes were final</li>",
      "\t<li>If you do see any issues with undo/redo, then please do try to determine the precise steps to recreate the issue, otherwise we may need your project to be sent also with your ticket</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Fixes for high CPU utilisation in the IDE</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>The last couple of GMS2 releases have shown higher-than-expected CPU usage values on some machines (particularly on Windows), and this release aims to reduce that back down again</li>",
      "\t<li>In theory, you shouldn't see any issues and hopefully CPU usage values are considerably lower on your machine now - if you find your usage numbers have for some reason gone up noticeably, then please do file a ticket about this</li>",
      "\t<li>However, please be aware we have found some of our machines saw very little benefit - we're still looking into this, so please don't report tickets if CPU usage has stayed about the same for you</li>",
      "\t<li>Similarly, if your CPU values are lower now, you may realise that whilst the bottom dock / the Output Window is expanded, then CPU usage remains quite a bit higher than if the dock is collapsed - again, we are aware, so please don't report tickets for this</li> ",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Changed our FFmpeg integration</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Should make importing and previewing sounds more reliable (there was also a specific bug fix for importing single sounds at a time could cause IDE crashes)</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Additional editors have been enabled within the Inspector</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>These are: Notes, Scripts, Sequences (and individual sequence instances - e.g., inside the Room Editor), Shaders, and Tilesets</li>",
      "\t<li>Now, if any of these are selected the Inspector will populate with many of the settings relevant to that asset/instance</li>",
      "\t<li>If you multi-select items, then be aware only the relevant shared fields will be inspectable</li>",
      "\t<li>Another reminder that the Inspector can be accessed via Window > Inspector</li>",
      "\t<li><i>Other editors will be added in future versions, so please don't bug that they are missing - 2.3.3 will be just the above</i></li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Misc Important Changes To Be Aware Of</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Room Editor: Instances in child rooms now always inherit variable values from their immediate parent room instead of the top-level room in their inheritance chain</li>",
      "\t<li>Variable Definitions: Child object List items which reference other variable definitions no longer give \"Undefined Variable\" compile errors during builds</li>",

      "\t<li>Source Control: Fixed GMS2 going unstable when reloading assets after a conflict</li>",
      "\t<li>And in the manual we have added some new pages for recent additions and lots of typo/formatting fixes for various older pages</li>",

      "<h2>Changes/Fixes since IDE 300</h2>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Please note this release is mostly about the runtime fix, so ensure your runtime updates, but we did add a couple of very small IDE fixes</li>",
      "\t<li>Inspector: Fixed the content for a tooltip on an Object's Events tab and also made it disappear properly once an event has been added</li>",
      "\t<li>Preferences: Interacting with Keystore in any way when using Android Studio 4.2 results in a \"JDK not installed correctly\" error</li>",

      "<ul>",

      "\t<li>Building Projects: Cached Spine textures are now cleaned and rebuilt after changing texture page size settings</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [YYC] Builds will again succeed when Windows' decimal format uses a comma [was only broken in 2.3.3 Beta 1]</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: GMS2 no longer crashes if any JSDoc contains )( after @func name [also if \"@func\" was repeated elsewhere in your comment]</li>",

      "\t<li>Game Options: [Android] Icons page is now able to load 32bit .png images</li>",
      "\t<li>Game Options: [Android] Icons page's file picker now only allows .png files, which stops accidental build errors as only .pngs are allowed by the Android tools</li>",
      "\t<li>Note the above change is for the old/legacy Icons page - it does not affect the newer Adaptive Icons page, as GMS2 will always save a suitable .png for you when using that tool</li>",
      "\t<li>Game Options: UWP's Title ID can now be set reliably, rather than maybe forcing \"16777216\" depending on your individual ID</li>",

      "\t<li>Room Editor: Duplicating a room now preserves its instance creation order values</li>",
      "\t<li>Room Editor: Undoing the drawing of tiles now saves this change properly, which means you won't still see the stale tiles in-game or when reopening the room</li>",
      "\t<li>Room Editor: Reordering the instance creation order list now flags the project needs to be saved, so builds will now pick up the change correctly</li>",
      "\t<li>Sequence Editor: You can now undo (Ctrl+Z) changes to the dopesheet's length value [may actually have already been fixed for 290]</li>",
      "\t<li>Sound Editor: .ogg sound file previews will now reliably play from the start of the audio file each time [may actually have already been fixed for 290]</li>",
      "\t<li>Source Control: The Mac IDE cannot push to an online repository if your keychain has not already been configured with your password, etc., so when GMS2 detects this error we have added a dialog saying this and (briefly) how to fix</li>",
      "\t<li>Sprite Editor: Stopped GMS2 going unstable when cutting and pasting a frame from one sprite to another if that source sprite has existing frame corruption</li>",

      "<h3>Bundled Windows/macOS runtimes with the installer</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Depending on which IDE installer you downloaded, you now have the matching runtime for just that one platform included inside the installer</li>",
      "\t<li>This means as soon as GMS2 is installed you can create/open projects and test them on Windows or macOS (so if you're a Trial user, then there are no further downloads required)</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Unbundled Git tools from the installer</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>GMS2 now relies on external source control tools you point to in Preferences, rather than us shipping a specific version of the Git tools</li>",
      "\t<li>This means you can point at your own installed-and-configured Git client and use its own authentication settings, etc. It also means your tools can easily be kept up-to-date with external changes by Github, etc.</li>",
      "\t<li>Note: This does mean that you will need to reconfigure your Git settings one time in Preferences before your projects are going to show as SCM-enabled!</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Implemented a new Undo system</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>All undo and redo actions have been changed to use a new per-asset history system, which brings a few benefits:</li>",
      "\t<li>It's always going to be the most recent action which is undone - e.g., in previous versions of GMS2 if you created a Sprite, resized it in the Sprite Editor, then opened it in the Image Editor and added some content, then switched focus back to the Sprite Editor and pressed Ctrl+Z it would be the resize which was undone and not any of the later changes in the Image Editor. Now, GMS2 would set focus back to the Image Editor and undo your last change there, and pressing Undo again would step back through the change history for the asset as you would expect.</li>",
      "\t<li>It's also now possible to undo a change to an asset after you have closed its editor - in previous versions of GMS2, as soon as you closed an editor your changes were final</li>",
      "\t<li>If you do see any issues with undo/redo, then please do try to determine the precise steps to recreate the issue, otherwise we may need your project to be sent also with your ticket</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Fixes for high CPU utilisation in the IDE</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>The last couple of GMS2 releases have shown higher-than-expected CPU usage values on some machines (particularly on Windows), and this release aims to reduce that back down again</li>",
      "\t<li>In theory, you shouldn't see any issues and hopefully CPU usage values are considerably lower on your machine now - if you find your usage numbers have for some reason gone up noticeably, then please do file a ticket about this</li>",
      "\t<li>However, please be aware we have found some of our machines saw very little benefit - we're still looking into this, so please don't report tickets if CPU usage has stayed about the same for you</li>",
      "\t<li>Similarly, if your CPU values are lower now, you may realise that whilst the bottom dock / the Output Window is expanded, then CPU usage remains quite a bit higher than if the dock is collapsed - again, we are aware, so please don't report tickets for this</li> ",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Changed our FFmpeg integration</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Should make importing and previewing sounds more reliable (there was also a specific bug fix for importing single sounds at a time could cause IDE crashes)</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Additional editors have been enabled within the Inspector</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>These are: Notes, Scripts, Sequences (and individual sequence instances - e.g., inside the Room Editor), Shaders, and Tilesets</li>",
      "\t<li>Now, if any of these are selected the Inspector will populate with many of the settings relevant to that asset/instance</li>",
      "\t<li>If you multi-select items, then be aware only the relevant shared fields will be inspectable</li>",
      "\t<li>Another reminder that the Inspector can be accessed via Window > Inspector</li>",
      "\t<li><i>Other editors will be added in future versions, so please don't bug that they are missing - 2.3.3 will be just the above</i></li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Misc Important Changes To Be Aware Of</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Room Editor: Instances in child rooms now always inherit variable values from their immediate parent room instead of the top-level room in their inheritance chain</li>",
      "\t<li>Variable Definitions: Child object List items which reference other variable definitions no longer give \"Undefined Variable\" compile errors during builds</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Other Bugs Fixed</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>AnimCurve Editor: Implement missing preview animations for all curves in the Curve Library</li>",

      "\t<li>Depending on which IDE installer you downloaded, you now have the matching runtime for just that one platform included inside the installer</li>",
      "\t<li>This means as soon as GMS2 is installed you can create/open projects and test them on Windows or macOS (so if you're a Trial user, then there are no further downloads required)</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Unbundled Git tools from the installer</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>GMS2 now relies on external source control tools you point to in Preferences, rather than us shipping a specific version of the Git tools</li>",
      "\t<li>This means you can point at your own installed-and-configured Git client and use its own authentication settings, etc. It also means your tools can easily be kept up-to-date with external changes by Github, etc.</li>",
      "\t<li>Note: This does mean that you will need to reconfigure your Git settings one time in Preferences before your projects are going to show as SCM-enabled!</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Implemented a new Undo system</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>All undo and redo actions have been changed to use a new per-asset history system, which brings a few benefits:</li>",
      "\t<li>It's always going to be the most recent action which is undone - e.g., in previous versions of GMS2 if you created a Sprite, resized it in the Sprite Editor, then opened it in the Image Editor and added some content, then switched focus back to the Sprite Editor and pressed Ctrl+Z it would be the resize which was undone and not any of the later changes in the Image Editor. Now, GMS2 would set focus back to the Image Editor and undo your last change there, and pressing Undo again would step back through the change history for the asset as you would expect.</li>",
      "\t<li>It's also now possible to undo a change to an asset after you have closed its editor - in previous versions of GMS2, as soon as you closed an editor your changes were final</li>",

      "\t<li>In theory, you shouldn't see any issues and hopefully CPU usage values are considerably lower on your machine now - if you find your usage numbers have for some reason gone up noticeably, then please do file a ticket about this</li>",
      "\t<li>However, please be aware we have found some of our machines saw very little benefit - we're still looking into this, so please don't report tickets if CPU usage has stayed about the same for you</li>",
      "\t<li>Similarly, if your CPU values are lower now, you may realise that whilst the bottom dock / the Output Window is expanded, then CPU usage remains quite a bit higher than if the dock is collapsed - again, we are aware, so please don't report tickets for this</li> ",

      "<h3>Changed our FFmpeg integration</h3>",

      "\t<li>Should make importing and previewing sounds more reliable (there was also a specific bug fix for importing single sounds at a time could cause IDE crashes)</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Additional editors have been enabled within the Inspector</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>These are: Notes, Scripts, Sequences (and individual sequence instances - e.g., inside the Room Editor), Shaders, and Tilesets</li>",
      "\t<li>Now, if any of these are selected the Inspector will populate with many of the settings relevant to that asset/instance</li>",
      "\t<li>If you multi-select items, then be aware only the relevant shared fields will be inspectable</li>",
      "\t<li>Another reminder that the Inspector can be accessed via Window > Inspector</li>",
      "\t<li><i>Other editors will be added in future versions, so please don't bug that they are missing - 2.3.3 will be just the above</i></li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Misc Important Changes To Be Aware Of</h3>",

      "\t<li>Room Editor: Instances in child rooms now always inherit variable values from their immediate parent room instead of the top-level room in their inheritance chain</li>",
      "\t<li>Variable Definitions: Child object List items which reference other variable definitions no longer give \"Undefined Variable\" compile errors during builds</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Other Bugs Fixed</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>AnimCurve Editor: Implement missing preview animations for all curves in the Curve Library</li>",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: Creating/renaming assets in groups no longer requires closing/opening the group to see the change</li>",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: Plugged a memory leak when adding resources to texture/audio groups</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Now quickly checks .ogg/.wav sounds to see if they are valid before passing straight through, will force a recompile if issues are detected</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Made a number of various improvements to stop large projects taking a very long time to compile for some users</li>",

      "\t<li>Code Editor: Do...Until statements now obey the \"Enable code-folding\" Preference, rather than always folding</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Fixed an exception in gutter tooltips if you incorrectly used [ ] instead of { } for code blocks (and we added a sensible tooltip for this coding mistake)</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: MMB or F1 on a function with the same name as its Script will now place the caret at the correct location for the function, rather than leaving it on line 1</li>",

      "\t<li>Code Editor: weak_ref_create()'s \"ref\" variable no longer shows warnings</li>",

      "<h2>Changes since IDE 2.3.3.570</h2>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Undo: Stopped GMS2 going unstable when undo-ing placing an asset in the Room Editor</li>",
      "\t<li>Sprite Editor: Fixed the abilty to add multiple images at once</li>",
      "\t<li>Note: We are aware that if the images are different sizes, then this currently triggers a redundant file-watcher prompt</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "",
      "<h2>IDE 2.3.3.570</h2>",
      "<h3>Added Windows/macOS Runtimes Into The Installer</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Depending on which IDE installer you downloaded, you now have the matching runtime for just that one platform included inside the installer</li>",
      "\t<li>This means as soon as GMS2 is installed you can create/open projects and test them on Windows or macOS (so if you're a free licence user, then there are no further downloads required)</li>",
      "\t<li>(If your licence allows other modules, these will still be downloaded on startup as per normal)</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Removed Git Tools From The Installer</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>GMS2 now relies on external source control tools you point to in Preferences, rather than us shipping a specific version of the Git tools</li>",
      "\t<li>This means you can point at your own installed-and-configured Git client and use its own authentication settings, etc. It also means your tools can easily be kept up-to-date with external changes by Github, etc.</li>",
      "\t<li>Note 1: This does mean that if you were using source control inside GMS2 previously you will need to reconfigure your Git settings one time in Preferences before your projects are going to show as SCM-enabled!</li>",
      "\t<li>Note 2: The Mac IDE cannot push to an online repository if your keychain has not already been pre-configured with your password, etc., so when GMS2 detects this error we have added a dialog saying this and (briefly) how to fix</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>New Undo System</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>All undo and redo actions have been changed to use a new per-asset history system, which brings a few benefits:</li>",
      "\t<li>It's always going to be the most recent action which is undone - e.g., in previous releases if you create a Sprite, resize it in the Sprite Editor, open it in the Image Editor and add some content, then click the Sprite Editor and press Ctrl+Z it would be the resize which was undone rather than the Image Editor change. Now, focus is set back to the Image Editor and the last change there is undone (and pressing Undo again would step back through the change history for the asset as you would expect)</li>",
      "\t<li>It's also now possible to undo a change to an asset after you have closed its editor - as above, the editor would be reopened and the change performed</li>",
      "\t<li>If you do see any issues with undo/redo, then please do try to determine the precise steps to recreate the issue, otherwise we may need your project to be sent also with your ticket</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Fixes For High CPU Usage</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>The last couple of GMS2 releases have shown higher-than-expected CPU usage values on some machines (particularly on Windows), and this release aims to reduce that back down again</li>",
      "\t<li>In theory, you shouldn't see any issues and hopefully CPU usage values are considerably lower on your machine now - if you find your usage numbers have for some reason gone up noticeably, then please do file a ticket about this and include a project which shows the issue on your machine</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Updated FFmpeg Tools Version</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Should make importing and previewing sounds more reliable</li>",
      "\t<li>There was also a specific bug fix for Add Existing importing a single sound from another project could in some cases cause GMS2 to crash</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Additional Inspector Editors</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>These are: Objects (and individual object instances inside the Sequence Editor), Notes, Scripts, Sequences (and instances of), Shaders, and Tilesets</li>",
      "\t<li>Now, if any of these are selected the Inspector will populate with many of the settings relevant to that asset/instance</li>",
      "\t<li>If you multi-select items, then be aware only the relevant shared fields will be inspectable</li>",
      "\t<li>Another reminder that the Inspector can be accessed via Window > Inspector</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Misc Important Changes To Be Aware Of</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Now quickly checks .ogg/.wav sounds to see if they are actually valid before passing straight through to your game output folder, will force a recompile if issues are detected</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [HTML5] Added additional iframe focus-detection code in response to Itch.io/Newgrounds changes</li>",
      "\t<li>Room Editor: Instances in child rooms now always inherit variable values from their immediate parent room instead of the top-level room in their inheritance chain</li>",
      "\t<li>Variable Definitions: Child object List items which reference other variable definitions no longer give \"Undefined Variable\" compile errors during builds</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Other Bugs Fixed</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>AnimCurve Editor: Implemented little preview animations for all curves in the Curve Library</li>",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: Creating/renaming assets in groups no longer requires closing/opening the group to see the change</li>",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: Plugged a memory leak when adding resources to texture/audio groups</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Made a number of various improvements to stop large projects taking a very long time to compile for some users</li>",

      "\t<li>Code Editor (DnD): \"Expression\" field of Apply To node now has a working autocomplete dialog</li>",

      "\t<li>Font Editor: GMS2 no longer goes unstable when quickly scrolling the fonts list</li>",
      "\t<li>Game Options: Android's Icons page is now able to load 32bit .png images</li>",
      "\t<li>Game Options: Android's Icons page's file picker now only allows .png files, which stops accidental build errors as only .pngs are allowed by the Android tools</li>",
      "\t<li>Note the above change is for the old/legacy Icons page - it does not affect the newer Adaptive Icons page, as GMS2 will always save a suitable .png for you when using that tool</li>",
      "\t<li>Game Options: UWP's Title ID can now be set reliably, rather than maybe forcing \"16777216\" (depending on your actual unique ID)</li>",

      "<h2>Changes since IDE 2.3.3.570</h2>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: A further fix for MMB/F1 on functions with the same name as its Script to place the caret on the correct line even in fullscreen code editors in separate workspace tabs</li>",
      "\t<li>Image Editor: Fixed the Reverse Frames menu command not working in IDE v2.3.3.570</li>",
      "\t<li>Undo: Stopped GMS2 going unstable when undo-ing placing an asset in the Room Editor</li>",
      "\t<li>Sprite Editor: Fixed the abilty to add multiple images at once</li>",
      "\t<li>Note: We are aware that if the images are different sizes, then this currently triggers a redundant file-watcher prompt</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "",
      "<h2>IDE 2.3.3.570</h2>",
      "<h3>Added Windows/macOS Runtimes Into The Installer</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Depending on which IDE installer you downloaded, you now have the matching runtime for just that one platform included inside the installer</li>",
      "\t<li>This means as soon as GMS2 is installed you can create/open projects and test them on Windows or macOS (so if you're a free licence user, then there are no further downloads required)</li>",
      "\t<li>(If your licence allows other modules, these will still be downloaded on startup as per normal)</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Removed Git Tools From The Installer</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>GMS2 now relies on external source control tools you point to in Preferences, rather than us shipping a specific version of the Git tools</li>",
      "\t<li>This means you can point at your own installed-and-configured Git client and use its own authentication settings, etc. It also means your tools can easily be kept up-to-date with external changes by Github, etc.</li>",
      "\t<li>Note 1: This does mean that if you were using source control inside GMS2 previously you will need to reconfigure your Git settings one time in Preferences before your projects are going to show as SCM-enabled!</li>",
      "\t<li>Note 2: The Mac IDE cannot push to an online repository if your keychain has not already been pre-configured with your password, etc., so when GMS2 detects this error we have added a dialog saying this and (briefly) how to fix</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>New Undo System</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>All undo and redo actions have been changed to use a new per-asset history system, which brings a few benefits:</li>",
      "\t<li>It's always going to be the most recent action which is undone - e.g., in previous releases if you create a Sprite, resize it in the Sprite Editor, open it in the Image Editor and add some content, then click the Sprite Editor and press Ctrl+Z it would be the resize which was undone rather than the Image Editor change. Now, focus is set back to the Image Editor and the last change there is undone (and pressing Undo again would step back through the change history for the asset as you would expect)</li>",
      "\t<li>It's also now possible to undo a change to an asset after you have closed its editor - as above, the editor would be reopened and the change performed</li>",
      "\t<li>If you do see any issues with undo/redo, then please do try to determine the precise steps to recreate the issue, otherwise we may need your project to be sent also with your ticket</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Fixes For High CPU Usage</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>The last couple of GMS2 releases have shown higher-than-expected CPU usage values on some machines (particularly on Windows), and this release aims to reduce that back down again</li>",
      "\t<li>In theory, you shouldn't see any issues and hopefully CPU usage values are considerably lower on your machine now - if you find your usage numbers have for some reason gone up noticeably, then please do file a ticket about this and include a project which shows the issue on your machine</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Updated FFmpeg Tools Version</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Should make importing and previewing sounds more reliable</li>",
      "\t<li>There was also a specific bug fix for Add Existing importing a single sound from another project could in some cases cause GMS2 to crash</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Additional Inspector Editors</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>These are: Objects (and individual object instances inside the Sequence Editor), Notes, Scripts, Sequences (and instances of), Shaders, and Tilesets</li>",
      "\t<li>Now, if any of these are selected the Inspector will populate with many of the settings relevant to that asset/instance</li>",
      "\t<li>If you multi-select items, then be aware only the relevant shared fields will be inspectable</li>",
      "\t<li>Another reminder that the Inspector can be accessed via Window > Inspector</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Misc Important Changes To Be Aware Of</h3>",
      "<ul>",

      "\t<li>Building Projects: [HTML5] Added additional iframe focus-detection code in response to Itch.io/Newgrounds changes</li>",
      "\t<li>Room Editor: Instances in child rooms now always inherit variable values from their immediate parent room instead of the top-level room in their inheritance chain</li>",
      "\t<li>Variable Definitions: Child object List items which reference other variable definitions no longer give \"Undefined Variable\" compile errors during builds</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Other Bugs Fixed</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>AnimCurve Editor: Implemented little preview animations for all curves in the Curve Library</li>",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: Creating/renaming assets in groups no longer requires closing/opening the group to see the change</li>",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: Plugged a memory leak when adding resources to texture/audio groups</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Made a number of various improvements to stop large projects taking a very long time to compile for some users</li>",

      "\t<li>Building projects: [iOS YYC] Mac IDE fix for the error 'tell app \\\\\"Xcode\\\\\" to quit' which appears for some users</li>",
      "\t<li>Colour Picker: Hue, Sat, and Val sliders all now work again</li>",

      "\t<li>Code Editor (DnD): \"Create Sequence\" node no longer shows a red error tint when the Target field is empty (because this is a valid value)</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (DnD): \"Expression\" field of Apply To node now has a working autocomplete dialog</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (DnD): \"New Struct\" node's title no longer just says \"New\"</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (DnD): Asset fields on nodes' \"Drop here to assign ...\" message now correctly says \"asset\" instead of \"resource\"</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (DnD): Improved the Toolbox's search result sorting method</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (DnD): Using MMB on a function in an Object now opens the Script containing that function</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Do...Until statements now obey the \"Enable code-folding\" Preference, rather than always folding</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Fixed an exception in gutter tooltips if you incorrectly used [ ] instead of { } for code blocks (and we added a sensible tooltip for this coding mistake)</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: MMB or F1 on a function with the same name as its Script will now place the caret at the correct location for the function, rather than leaving it on line 1</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Code errors detected on a line after a comment written in Japanese will now blame the correct line number</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: weak_ref_create()'s \"ref\" variable no longer shows warnings</li>",

      "\t<li>Demos: Importing some older official demos no longer shows an unwanted \"Old Project Format\" dialog</li>",
      "\t<li>Font Editor: GMS2 no longer goes unstable when quickly scrolling the fonts list</li>",
      "\t<li>Game Options: Android's Icons page is now able to load 32bit .png images</li>",
      "\t<li>Game Options: Android's Icons page's file picker now only allows .png files, which stops accidental build errors as only .pngs are allowed by the Android tools</li>",
      "\t<li>Note the above change is for the old/legacy Icons page - it does not affect the newer Adaptive Icons page, as GMS2 will always save a suitable .png for you when using that tool</li>",

      "\t<li>When this is enabled (and it is enabled by default in Betas going forward) this replaces the old syntax checking system and the autocomplete with much more informative versions</li>",
      "\t<li>The system will catch syntax errors, coding mistakes which would lead to in-game errors, unused code paths or variables, and also identify ways in which your code could be optimised</li>",
      "\t<li>Let us know if you have projects which get false information or other issues which we need to fix</li>",
      "\t<li>Similarly, you will see that a lot of the Preferences for enabling functionality in this new system are currently disabled while we await feedback and for us to finish up a few bits also - however, you are welcome to try them on your own projects and let us know what you think</li>",
