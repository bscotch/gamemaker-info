      "<h2>Changes Since 2022.9.1.51</h2>",
      "<h3>Bugs Fixed</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Increased the number of retries when a runtime fails to download and added a 2-second pause between each retry, so GM should no longer get stuck for a long time on the progress bar</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Now alerts you when two functions are declared with the same name in a single script/event, as this has always been a compile fail</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Code referencing asset names is now updated correctly when those asset are renamed in the Asset Browser (if you have this Preference enabled)</li>",
      "</ul>",

      "<h2>2022.9.1.51</h2>",
      "<h3>Opera Account Settings Migration</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>In previous releases, if you used one email address for your GameMaker account and a different email for your Opera Account and you have already converted your GameMaker account to be an Opera account on our website, then this would cause your Preferences and Recent Projects, etc., to be “lost”, because GameMaker is now looking in a new folder for them</li>",
      "\t<li>This version will rename the original folder for you and avoid you having to “migrate” your settings manually; however, it will only do this if you have not converted already - if you have already converted your account and so this issue applies to you, please see <a href=\"https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/6893026074525\" target=\"_blank\">our FAQ for how to quickly and easily recover your settings</a></li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Changes To The Default Project Layout</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>The default project layout now includes the Inspector as a new left-hand dock (but of course it is freely movable and dockable) and no longer includes Recent Windows as a panel inside the right-hand dock</li>",
      "\t<li>Though the Inspector has been around for a long time already, we are now bringing it to the front and making it more relevant inside other editors</li>",
      "\t<li>Please note that any existing layouts in your projects are of course unaffected by this change, and so if you want to see the changes you can use Layout -> Reset Layout menubar option. (If you have a highly customised layout you use in your projects you may also want to use Save Layout and ensure you backup your current layout.)</li>",
      "\t<li>Recent Windows can still be opened from the Windows menubar entry and added to your project layout again if you wish</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Changes To How GameMaker Loads/Saves Game Options</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Up until now, GameMaker always treated the licence of the last person to open a project as <i>the definitive list of game options that project requires</i> - so if one team member has a lot of targets on their licence all of them would be configured and if the project was then shared with a new team member who only had Test, a lot of those options would be removed again</li>",
      "\t<li>Now, your options will “merge” - so if you have team members who have different licence types, the Game Options values will remain in the project and cover everyone’s licences</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>New Room Inspector And Changes To The Room Editor Layout</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>The new Room Inspector is how you will now access many of the settings for rooms</li>",
      "\t<li>Before, all of a room’s settings and its layers were cramped into a single panel; now, all of the settings are handled as part of the Inspector and the Layers panel is a dockable panel which can be detached and placed where you want</li>",
      "\t<li>The Inspector UI is also more dynamic/responsive and only shows certain functionality if it’s relevant (e.g., Inheritance settings are only shown in the Inspector if you are in a child room, rather than always being shown in the old Room Editor layout)</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>”Opera GX” Target Rebranded As “GX.games”</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>The target has always been part of a whole ecosystem of releasing your games on the GX.games site and sharing them with others (for free or as paid content), so this new name clarifies that</li>",
      "\t<li>If you have not had a look at <a href=\"https://gx.games\" target=\"_blank\">GX.games</a> and what it offers, please do check it out and play a few games, see if it’s a route you would like to take also</li>",
      "\t<li>You already have access to publish games on it (for free) as part of your Opera Account and you can also see <a href=\"https://gamemaker.io/en/tutorials/publish-to-gxgames-tutorial\" target=\"_blank\">our tutorial about what publishing on GX.games involves</a> if you want more info</li>",
      "\t<li>Also added a new \"os_gxgames\" constant (which duplicates the existing \"os_operagx\", so you do not need to change existing code) in order to be consistent in-game with this branding change</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>New Options For Texture Group Management</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>You will now find the texture groups editor has new controls for whether you want to split textures off into their own data files on disk during your builds, as this can be required by bigger games on some platforms which have memory caps on how much data you can have loaded at any moment (e.g., GX.games only allows 2GB)</li>",
      "\t<li>You can then use the matching 2022.9 runtimes to load/unload these groups in-game as you require</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>New Visual Node “Add Motion”</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>This new function takes a direction and speed and modifies the in-built hspeed and vspeed values accordingly - so you have the one node to manage, but can change several values at once behind-the-scenes (the node performs the following code: <i>hspeed += speed * dcos(direction); vspeed += speed * -dsin(direction);</i>)</li>",
      "\t<li>The new node will be part of an upcoming tutorial, so please keep an eye on <a href=\"https://gamemaker.io/en/tutorials\" target=\"_blank\">our tutorials website</a> for more information</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Misc Other Changes To Be Aware Of</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Opera Account users who have never logged-in on the website would see an unhelpful \"UID not present\" error message in previous releases - this is now the correct \"Please complete your profile\" message</li>",
      "\t<li>Opera Account login now has a proper error message when a timeout has happened, letting you know you simply need to try again</li>",
      "\t<li>Opera Account users would receive an unhelpful message in older GM versions when accidentally attempting to login by typing in their old username and password details - this message has now been improved to say your old details no longer work, now you have converted your account, and to simply use the Opera sign-in button instead</li>",
      "\t<li>The micro web server is now always stopped when the main IDE is closed, which stops a number of issues (such as “GameMaker is already running” when trying to install an update), but please be aware of this if you’re testing your games after closing GM itself</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Bugs Fixed</h3>",
      "<ul>  ",
      "\t<li>AnimCurve Editor: GM no longer goes unstable after deleting all curve content then closing and reopening the editor</li>",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: ALT+I to create a new included file resource works again, after being broken in 2022.8</li>",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: Duplicating a sound now correctly renames its new source audio file also, stops an error when later running the project [note that if you have an audio asset already in this state you might need to rename its source file manually one time]</li>",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: GM no longer crashes when attempting \"Add Existing\" for an asset which has a cyclic dependency in its original project</li>",
      "\t<li>Bookmarks: Bookmarks on a line of code now remember if they should reopen as a floating editor in the workspace, rather than always opening as a new code editor workspace tab on their own</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Mac IDE] [HTML5] Fixed being unable to build projects that contain a Spine sprite</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [macOS] Fixed being unable to build a project from the Windows IDE if it is larger than 2GB</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Xbox GDK YYC] Long path names can still require subst in the Visual Studio/GDK tools, so subst has been re-enabled for this target</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Xbox GDK] Explorer is now opened to the correct location when a build succeeds, rather than an unexpected subfolder</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Macro definitions which contain pre-increment operations no longer return a compile error</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Fixed that some 2022.8 projects failed to build/clean due to \"Value cannot be null. (Parameter 'key')\" asset compiler error in GMRoom</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Fixed that Supura… no longer builds in recent versions due to SWF files which worked in older GM versions now being marked as incompatible</li>",

      "\t<li>Code Editor: Hovering over \"Add new event\" and then \"Single Pane\" no longer immediately closes the context menu</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Fixed an issue where pre-2022.8 project layouts containing open code editors expanded all folded code and lost the ability to code fold until the code editor was closed and reopened manually</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: skeleton_skin_create() is now highlighted as an in-built function (Feather or Syntax Errors - both had the issue in 2022.8 and both are fixed now)</li>",
      "\t<li>Crash Reporter: GMWebServer.exe is not ended properly when closing the IDE, appears to sometimes incorrectly trigger the crash reporter [see the note higher up]</li>",
      "\t<li>Debugger: [Mac IDE] Fullscreen IDEs opening windowed debuggers restored from a layout file are now sized correctly (no longer results in a fullscreen debugger window with black bars to fill the gaps)</li>",
      "\t<li>Device Manager: [Mac IDE] \"Detect Browsers\" now detects the full application name for Opera GX correctly, so that browser can now be used as a target device when doing HTML5 builds</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: [Mac IDE] Now shows messages for all Objects correctly, rather than requiring each Object to be opened first before you were informed of its values</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: ArgumentIdentity variables passed to functions now promote their types correctly from the parameter type</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: array_create() return type is now correctly treated as Real, rather than always incorrectly treated as Any</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Code in the format \"var a=1, b=a+1;\" no longer results in an error that \"a\" was treated as out of scope when \"b\" tried to use it</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Creation of new assets or renaming existing assets now reparses the entire project correctly, fixes issues in previous releases with it missing new or old errors</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Now alerts correctly when two functions with the same name are in a script/event (as this is a compile fail and you will need to fix your code)</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Errors in timeline scripts no longer show a red cross image in the Feather Messages \"Resource\" column</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Can now open Timeline assets mentioned in the Feather Messages window by double-clicking them</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Unexpected GM1028 messages are no longer incorrectly raised in some circumstances</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: If an enum has the same name as an asset in the Asset Browser, the tooltip for the enum is now shown correctly (rather than always showing the asset's details, like previous releases did)</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Inner and outer scope hinting no longer breaks when names are reused</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Refactoring operations no longer mangles parentheses of function signatures and new expressions in some circumstances</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Rename identifier & Go To Issue now works correctly even when the Inspector is open</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Renaming a function now correctly refactors the function definition line as well, rather than only renaming all the uses of that function elsewhere in your code</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that Rename Identifier did not work for globalvar, static vars, assets, enums or enum members</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that Rename Identifier also did not work properly inside Object event code editors</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that it was possible for GM to hang after the Rename Identifier window closes</li>",

      "\t<li>Project Saving: [Windows IDE] A dialog is now shown to you whenever GameMaker is unable to rename an asset because its file path on disk is too long [in previous releases this was only written to the ui.log, so you had to open that to see why the rename didn’t work]</li>",

    "version": "2022.5.0.8",
    "release_notes": [
      "<h3>.NET 6 Core Support and New Build Pipeline</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>We have changed pretty much everything on our end as to how we make GameMaker installers and also the runtimes you use (more on the runtimes a bit further down...)</li>",
      "    \t<li>This involves the use of .NET 6 to build the installer and IDE, meaning we have <i>in almost all instances</i> done away with things like the 260-character file path limit on Windows and the use of the subst tool is now pretty much limited to when building for Android</li>",
      "    \t<li>We have also moved to a new build system in order to get even more rapid turnaround on our new versions and confirming bug fixes, etc., also to support the future LTS versions talked about on our recent 2022 update video</li>",
      "    \t<li>NOTE: As part of this massive update to all of our toolchain, you cannot use runtimes from these new versions with older IDEs / older runtimes with these newer IDEs - you must be using a current runtime with the current IDE, otherwise you will see your builds get stuck with the timer carrying on endlessly and in your ui.log you will simply be told “your runtime tools are missing or corrupt”</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>\"Windblown Particle\" Effect Layer Type</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>As we will showcase in our forthcoming new \"Windy Woods\" platformer Template, you can now choose a sprite and control the settings to be used for a wind-blown rain/snow/leaves type Effect in the Room Editor</li>",
      "\t<li>Add a new Filter/Effect layer into the Layers panel and then you will find the new effect type at the bottom of the drop-down list</li>",
      "\t<li>Note that as it says in the Effect dropdown list, \"Effects\" differ from \"Filters\" in that you currently cannot preview an Effect in the Room Editor and you will have to run your game to see it - although, this will be changed in a future release</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Alternate DNS Server Support When Checking The Runtimes Feed</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>Some users have had issues for a while where for whatever reason their system DNS would either not give them the runtime feed properly or it might use a cached copy for a lot longer than expected</li>",
      "    \t<li>If this applies to you, then you can now set an alternative DNS server IP address in Preferences > Runtime Feeds and this will then be used instead of your system's default</li>",
      "    \t<li>You can then go onto the “Master” feed’s own page and click the refresh button to hopefully see the list update immediately</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Sound Inspector Support</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>Allows you to set all the values in the usual editor, plus introduces the ability to see the waveform of your sound (so now you can spot unwanted silence in your sounds, etc.)</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Additions For Go To (Ctrl+T)</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>Added a new option to search all of Preferences, but ignoring all Redefine Keys matches, so that the matches you are shown are only the ones you wanted</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Added New Feather Functionality In The Beta Releases</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>For more information on getting the Beta version and trying out Feather, etc., please see <a href=\"https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018353352\" target=\"_blank\">our guide to GM Beta releases</a></li>",
      "<li>\"Find All References\" is now added via F3 when you have your cursor on a word in the Code Editor - you can step through matches by pressing F3 again or there is a little window in the top-right of the workspace to further control this and show the number of matches (Shift+F3 will also list all matches in the Output Window)</li>",
      "    \t<li>\"// feather\" directive controls can now disable GM1100 errors and also allow you to apply the directive to a whole folder of scripts</li>",
      "    \t<li>The “@context” scoping decoration now also has “@self” added as an alias, as some users expected this name</li>",
      "<li>Similarly “@ignore” can also now be used to achieve the same as “@disable” has done in previous releases</li>",
      "<li>There are also a large number of other bug fixes, which are listed below for informational purposes but only apply if you’re using a Beta version</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Misc Important Changes To Be Aware Of</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: [macOS] Added a proper warning/error for when your project fails to build due to missing provisioning profiles on the Mac, which should make it more obvious what you need to do to fix the issue</li>",
      "    \t<li>Game Options: Completely removed the Amazon Fire section - it has been redundant/legacy information for quite a while, as Amazon Fire target was removed, and so we have now removed the ability to see that content inside the IDE</li>",
      "    \t<li>Game Options: XDK/Xbox One's \"Program ID\" field now support general text, rather than only GUIDs - which is compliant with current submission requirements, but does mean you need to always check the values you’re using here, as the field will no longer detect formatting errors</li>",
      "    \t<li>General: GM could hang when there was a massive burst of debug logging output from a game, so there is now a cap on the maximum amount of logging which will be output each IDE tick - this will stop any hangs, but for games which log huge amounts of information you may see a slight delay before the logging appears</li>",
      "    \t<li>Generate Project Images: Generates a PS4 icon in the correct new format for current SDK versions - you might need to modify your existing icon images so they are compliant</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Other Bugs Fixed</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>AnimCurve Editor: Some labels were not localised and always used English, now they will use your chosen IDE language</li>",
      "    \t<li>Asset Browser: [Create Asset Window] Toggling between List/Grid view did not reliably affect future instances of the window, but now the setting will persist</li>",
      "    \t<li>Asset Browser: Fixed that GM could crash when duplicating any sprite asset if the project happened to contain a script asset called specifically \"Sprites\"</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Android] Cleaning your cache will (correctly) fail to delete cache folders if they are locked externally, but the Output Window log would still say the whole clean process was a \"success\" - now, it will catch that a folder couldn’t be cleaned and let you know accordingly</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Android YYC] Fixed that builds would fail if that project contained any variable which is set to a value greater than max signed Int</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: [iOS] Fixed that building a project which has a display name with an & symbol will fail</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: [OperaGX YYC] Now applies the Game Name value to the browser tab correctly</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: [OperaGX YYC] Fixed that if your project name contains a hyphen, then it would not run</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: [macOS] You are now able to stop projects running remotely on a Mac when using the Windows IDE</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: Fixed an Asset Compiler crash when handling corrupted sprites, such as \"sGrass\" in the project sent to us</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: [Mac IDE] Create Exe now/again opens the final output folder after creating a .dmg, rather than the temp folder it opened in the last release</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: [Ubuntu] GM will now unpack the AppImage before launching the game, which stops issues with extensions</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: Fixed an issue where some projects fail to run from the Steam IDE when using the alternative launcher, and so you might have just seen an empty cmd window</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor: network_send_raw() no longer says all 4 arguments are mandatory and gives a syntax error, now it knows the last one is optional</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor: Fixed a redundant error from being shown when using asset IDs as arguments in inherited constructors</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor: Fixed that using Ctrl+X on the first line would incorrectly remove everything but the last line</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor: Status bar helper text now only highlights the current argument you’re editing, not all of the arguments to the left as well</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor: [Light Skin] Status bar errors have been given more contrast between the black text and the dark red highlight</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor: Shaders now colour the whole words for #else and #endif</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor (Visual): Increasing DPI settings in Preferences no longer causes some node icons to glitch</li>",
      "    \t<li>Debugger: Fixed an issue where you could rapidly/accidentally launch the debugger button twice in a row and this could prevent clicks from being detected in Windows</li>",
      "    \t<li>Docs Integration: Opening the manual will now always default to opening the English copy if the current Preferences language does not actually have a manual (yet), rather than picking some unexpected other language</li>",
      "\t<li>Docs Integration: Fixed that only the English manual is available to select in all 500 Betas and specifically 2022.3.0.625</li>",
      "\t<li>Docs Integration: IT/JP/PO/KR now open their own translated manual when using online versions, rather than always opening English</li>",
      "    \t<li>Extension Editor: [FR] The translated version of \"Uncompress on build\" now fits in the space available</li>",
      "    \t<li>Feather: Skipping an argument in a function call now falls back to the types you originally defined</li>",
      "    \t<li>Feather: GM no longer goes unstable when accessing a struct in a global variable using dot notation and autocomplete</li>",
      "    \t<li>Feather: Auto-complete suggestions are now shown for variables inside functions when using globalvar</li>",

      "\t<li>Project Load: Mac IDE users see too many restrictions on where projects can be kept in 2022.5 (e.g., on the desktop)</li>",
      "\t<li>Project Save: Changes made after to a code editor which was already open in the project layout will not save correctly immediately after updating to 2022.5.0.8</li>",

      "<h3>.NET 6 Core Support and New Build Pipeline</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>We have changed pretty much everything on our end as to how we make GameMaker installers and also the runtimes you use (more on the runtimes a bit further down...)</li>",
      "    \t<li>This involves the use of .NET 6 to build the installer and IDE, meaning we have <i>in almost all instances</i> done away with things like the 260-character file path limit on Windows and the use of the subst tool is now pretty much limited to when building for Android</li>",
      "    \t<li>We have also moved to a new build system in order to get even more rapid turnaround on our new versions and confirming bug fixes, etc., also to support the future LTS versions talked about on our recent 2022 update video</li>",
      "    \t<li>NOTE: As part of this massive update to all of our toolchain, you cannot use runtimes from these new versions with older IDEs / older runtimes with these newer IDEs - you must be using a current runtime with the current IDE, otherwise you will see your builds get stuck with the timer carrying on endlessly and in your ui.log you will simply be told “your runtime tools are missing or corrupt”</li>",

      "<h3>\"Windblown Particle\" Effect Layer Type</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>As we will showcase in our forthcoming new \"Windy Woods\" platformer Template, you can now choose a sprite and control the settings to be used for a wind-blown rain/snow/leaves type Effect in the Room Editor</li>",
      "\t<li>Add a new Filter/Effect layer into the Layers panel and then you will find the new effect type at the bottom of the drop-down list</li>",
      "\t<li>Note that as it says in the Effect dropdown list, \"Effects\" differ from \"Filters\" in that you currently cannot preview an Effect in the Room Editor and you will have to run your game to see it - although, this will be changed in a future release</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Alternate DNS Server Support When Checking The Runtimes Feed</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>Some users have had issues for a while where for whatever reason their system DNS would either not give them the runtime feed properly or it might use a cached copy for a lot longer than expected</li>",
      "    \t<li>If this applies to you, then you can now set an alternative DNS server IP address in Preferences > Runtime Feeds and this will then be used instead of your system's default</li>",
      "    \t<li>You can then go onto the “Master” feed’s own page and click the refresh button to hopefully see the list update immediately</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Sound Inspector Support</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>Allows you to set all the values in the usual editor, plus introduces the ability to see the waveform of your sound (so now you can spot unwanted silence in your sounds, etc.)</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Additions For Go To (Ctrl+T)</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>Added a new option to search all of Preferences, but ignoring all Redefine Keys matches, so that the matches you are shown are only the ones you wanted</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Added New Feather Functionality In The Beta Releases</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>For more information on getting the Beta version and trying out Feather, etc., please see <a href=\"https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018353352\" target=\"_blank\">our guide to GM Beta releases</a></li>",
      "<li>\"Find All References\" is now added via F3 when you have your cursor on a word in the Code Editor - you can step through matches by pressing F3 again or there is a little window in the top-right of the workspace to further control this and show the number of matches (Shift+F3 will also list all matches in the Output Window)</li>",
      "    \t<li>\"// feather\" directive controls can now disable GM1100 errors and also allow you to apply the directive to a whole folder of scripts</li>",
      "    \t<li>The “@context” scoping decoration now also has “@self” added as an alias, as some users expected this name</li>",
      "<li>Similarly “@ignore” can also now be used to achieve the same as “@disable” has done in previous releases</li>",
      "<li>There are also a large number of other bug fixes, which are listed below for informational purposes but only apply if you’re using a Beta version</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Misc Important Changes To Be Aware Of</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: [macOS] Added a proper warning/error for when your project fails to build due to missing provisioning profiles on the Mac, which should make it more obvious what you need to do to fix the issue</li>",
      "    \t<li>Game Options: Completely removed the Amazon Fire section - it has been redundant/legacy information for quite a while, as Amazon Fire target was removed, and so we have now removed the ability to see that content inside the IDE</li>",
      "    \t<li>Game Options: XDK/Xbox One's \"Program ID\" field now support general text, rather than only GUIDs - which is compliant with current submission requirements, but does mean you need to always check the values you’re using here, as the field will no longer detect formatting errors</li>",
      "    \t<li>General: GM could hang when there was a massive burst of debug logging output from a game, so there is now a cap on the maximum amount of logging which will be output each IDE tick - this will stop any hangs, but for games which log huge amounts of information you may see a slight delay before the logging appears</li>",
      "    \t<li>Generate Project Images: Generates a PS4 icon in the correct new format for current SDK versions - you might need to modify your existing icon images so they are compliant</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Other Bugs Fixed</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>AnimCurve Editor: Some labels were not localised and always used English, now they will use your chosen IDE language</li>",
      "    \t<li>Asset Browser: [Create Asset Window] Toggling between List/Grid view did not reliably affect future instances of the window, but now the setting will persist</li>",
      "    \t<li>Asset Browser: Fixed that GM could crash when duplicating any sprite asset if the project happened to contain a script asset called specifically \"Sprites\"</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Android] Cleaning your cache will (correctly) fail to delete cache folders if they are locked externally, but the Output Window log would still say the whole clean process was a \"success\" - now, it will catch that a folder couldn’t be cleaned and let you know accordingly</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Android YYC] Fixed that builds would fail if that project contained any variable which is set to a value greater than max signed Int</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: [iOS] Fixed that building a project which has a display name with an & symbol will fail</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: [OperaGX YYC] Now applies the Game Name value to the browser tab correctly</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: [OperaGX YYC] Fixed that if your project name contains a hyphen, then it would not run</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: [macOS] You are now able to stop projects running remotely on a Mac when using the Windows IDE</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: Fixed an Asset Compiler crash when handling corrupted sprites, such as \"sGrass\" in the project sent to us</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: [Mac IDE] Create Exe now/again opens the final output folder after creating a .dmg, rather than the temp folder it opened in the last release</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: [Ubuntu] GM will now unpack the AppImage before launching the game, which stops issues with extensions</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: Fixed an issue where some projects fail to run from the Steam IDE when using the alternative launcher, and so you might have just seen an empty cmd window</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor: network_send_raw() no longer says all 4 arguments are mandatory and gives a syntax error, now it knows the last one is optional</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor: Fixed a redundant error from being shown when using asset IDs as arguments in inherited constructors</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor: Fixed that using Ctrl+X on the first line would incorrectly remove everything but the last line</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor: Status bar helper text now only highlights the current argument you’re editing, not all of the arguments to the left as well</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor: [Light Skin] Status bar errors have been given more contrast between the black text and the dark red highlight</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor: Shaders now colour the whole words for #else and #endif</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor (Visual): Increasing DPI settings in Preferences no longer causes some node icons to glitch</li>",
      "    \t<li>Debugger: Fixed an issue where you could rapidly/accidentally launch the debugger button twice in a row and this could prevent clicks from being detected in Windows</li>",
      "    \t<li>Docs Integration: Opening the manual will now always default to opening the English copy if the current Preferences language does not actually have a manual (yet), rather than picking some unexpected other language</li>",
      "\t<li>Docs Integration: Fixed that only the English manual is available to select in all 500 Betas and specifically 2022.3.0.625</li>",
      "\t<li>Docs Integration: IT/JP/PO/KR now open their own translated manual when using online versions, rather than always opening English</li>",
      "    \t<li>Extension Editor: [FR] The translated version of \"Uncompress on build\" now fits in the space available</li>",
      "    \t<li>Feather: Skipping an argument in a function call now falls back to the types you originally defined</li>",
      "    \t<li>Feather: GM no longer goes unstable when accessing a struct in a global variable using dot notation and autocomplete</li>",
      "    \t<li>Feather: Auto-complete suggestions are now shown for variables inside functions when using globalvar</li>",

      "<h3>.NET 6 Core Support and New Build Pipeline</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>We have changed pretty much everything on our end as to how we make GameMaker installers and also the runtimes you use (more on the runtimes a bit further down...)</li>",
      "    \t<li>This involves the use of .NET 6 to build the installer and IDE, meaning we have <i>in almost all instances</i> done away with things like the 260-character file path limit on Windows and the use of the subst tool is now pretty much limited to when building for Android</li>",
      "    \t<li>We have also moved to a new build system in order to get even more rapid turnaround on our new versions and confirming bug fixes, etc., also to support the future LTS versions talked about on our recent 2022 update video</li>",
      "    \t<li>NOTE: As part of this massive update to all of our toolchain, you cannot use runtimes from these new versions with older IDEs / older runtimes with these newer IDEs - you must be using a current runtime with the current IDE, otherwise you will see your builds get stuck with the timer carrying on endlessly and in your ui.log you will simply be told “your runtime tools are missing or corrupt”</li>",

      "<h3>\"Windblown Particle\" Effect Layer Type</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>As we will showcase in our forthcoming new \"Windy Woods\" platformer Template, you can now choose a sprite and control the settings to be used for a wind-blown rain/snow/leaves type Effect in the Room Editor</li>",
      "\t<li>Add a new Filter/Effect layer into the Layers panel and then you will find the new effect type at the bottom of the drop-down list</li>",
      "\t<li>Note that as it says in the Effect dropdown list, \"Effects\" differ from \"Filters\" in that you currently cannot preview an Effect in the Room Editor and you will have to run your game to see it - although, this will be changed in a future release</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Alternate DNS Server Support When Checking The Runtimes Feed</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>Some users have had issues for a while where for whatever reason their system DNS would either not give them the runtime feed properly or it might use a cached copy for a lot longer than expected</li>",
      "    \t<li>If this applies to you, then you can now set an alternative DNS server IP address in Preferences > Runtime Feeds and this will then be used instead of your system's default</li>",
      "    \t<li>You can then go onto the “Master” feed’s own page and click the refresh button to hopefully see the list update immediately</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Sound Inspector Support</h3>",
      "<ul>",

      "<h3>Additions For Go To (Ctrl+T)</h3>",
      "<ul>",

      "<li>\"Find All References\" is now added via F3 when you have your cursor on a word in the Code Editor - you can step through matches by pressing F3 again or there is a little window in the top-right of the workspace to further control this and show the number of matches (Shift+F3 will also list all matches in the Output Window)</li>",
      "    \t<li>\"// feather\" directive controls can now disable GM1100 errors and also allow you to apply the directive to a whole folder of scripts</li>",
      "    \t<li>The “@context” scoping decoration now also has “@self” added as an alias, as some users expected this name</li>",
      "<li>Similarly “@ignore” can also now be used to achieve the same as “@disable” has done in previous releases</li>",
      "<li>There are also a large number of other bug fixes, which are listed below for informational purposes but only apply if you’re using a Beta version</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Misc Important Changes To Be Aware Of</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: [macOS] Added a proper warning/error for when your project fails to build due to missing provisioning profiles on the Mac, which should make it more obvious what you need to do to fix the issue</li>",
      "    \t<li>Game Options: Completely removed the Amazon Fire section - it has been redundant/legacy information for quite a while, as Amazon Fire target was removed, and so we have now removed the ability to see that content inside the IDE</li>",
      "    \t<li>Game Options: XDK/Xbox One's \"Program ID\" field now support general text, rather than only GUIDs - which is compliant with current submission requirements, but does mean you need to always check the values you’re using here, as the field will no longer detect formatting errors</li>",
      "    \t<li>General: GM could hang when there was a massive burst of debug logging output from a game, so there is now a cap on the maximum amount of logging which will be output each IDE tick - this will stop any hangs, but for games which log huge amounts of information you may see a slight delay before the logging appears</li>",
      "    \t<li>Generate Project Images: Generates a PS4 icon in the correct new format for current SDK versions - you might need to modify your existing icon images so they are compliant</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Other Bugs Fixed</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>AnimCurve Editor: Some labels were not localised and always used English, now they will use your chosen IDE language</li>",

      "    \t<li>Asset Browser: Fixed that GM could crash when duplicating any sprite asset if the project happened to contain a script asset called specifically \"Sprites\"</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Android] Cleaning your cache will (correctly) fail to delete cache folders if they are locked externally, but the Output Window log would still say the whole clean process was a \"success\" - now, it will catch that a folder couldn’t be cleaned and let you know accordingly</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Android YYC] Fixed that builds would fail if that project contained any variable which is set to a value greater than max signed Int</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: [iOS] Fixed that building a project which has a display name with an & symbol will fail</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: [OperaGX YYC] Now applies the Game Name value to the browser tab correctly</li>",

      "    \t<li>Building Projects: Fixed an Asset Compiler crash when handling corrupted sprites, such as \"sGrass\" in the project sent to us</li>",

      "    \t<li>Building Projects: [Ubuntu] GM will now unpack the AppImage before launching the game, which stops issues with extensions</li>",
      "    \t<li>Building Projects: Fixed an issue where some projects fail to run from the Steam IDE when using the alternative launcher, and so you might have just seen an empty cmd window</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor: network_send_raw() no longer says all 4 arguments are mandatory and gives a syntax error, now it knows the last one is optional</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor: Fixed a redundant error from being shown when using asset IDs as arguments in inherited constructors</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor: Fixed that using Ctrl+X on the first line would incorrectly remove everything but the last line</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor: Status bar helper text now only highlights the current argument you’re editing, not all of the arguments to the left as well</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor: [Light Skin] Status bar errors have been given more contrast between the black text and the dark red highlight</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor: Shaders now colour the whole words for #else and #endif</li>",
      "    \t<li>Code Editor (Visual): Increasing DPI settings in Preferences no longer causes some node icons to glitch</li>",
      "    \t<li>Debugger: Fixed an issue where you could rapidly/accidentally launch the debugger button twice in a row and this could prevent clicks from being detected in Windows</li>",
      "    \t<li>Docs Integration: Opening the manual will now always default to opening the English copy if the current Preferences language does not actually have a manual (yet), rather than picking some unexpected other language</li>",
      "\t<li>Docs Integration: Fixed that only the English manual is available to select in all 500 Betas and specifically 2022.3.0.625</li>",
      "\t<li>Docs Integration: IT/JP/PO/KR now open their own translated manual when using online versions, rather than always opening English</li>",
      "    \t<li>Extension Editor: [FR] The translated version of \"Uncompress on build\" now fits in the space available</li>",
      "    \t<li>Feather: Skipping an argument in a function call now falls back to the types you originally defined</li>",
      "    \t<li>Feather: GM no longer goes unstable when accessing a struct in a global variable using dot notation and autocomplete</li>",
      "    \t<li>Feather: Auto-complete suggestions are now shown for variables inside functions when using globalvar</li>",
      "    \t<li>Feather: Fixed an error when accessing the \"self\" struct via accessor</li>",
      "    \t<li>Feather: Fixed that enums were previously considered as structs</li>",

      "\t<li>Feather: Hovering over globalvar variables now shows a tooltip</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Variables declared outside of variable method are no longer marked as undefined in the method</li>",

      "    <li>If you want to use Feather, please enable it in your Preferences</li>",
      "    <li>Also fixed a number of Syntax Errors issues which have been in Betas since Feather was introduced - so now if you do turn Feather off, the “old” errors are more reliable and the dialog populates itself automatically whenever you open it</li>",

      "<h3>Additions To Feather</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    <li>Feather now supports basic type narrowing using \"object_index\", \"typeof\", \"instanceof\", and the built-in \"is_\" functions. E.g. if (is_string(a) && typeof(b) == \"number\")</li>",
      "    <li>Changed Feather's tooltips to combine different tooltips into the one, so overlapping tooltips no longer occur for autocomplete, JSDoc content, and rules</li>",
      "    <li>Also changed Feather's tooltips to limit the number of struct fields if there are too many to show at once (and added a Preference for saying how many is \"too many\" for you)</li>",
      "    <li>Implemented that autocomplete highlights/prioritises in-scope variables at the top of the suggestion list</li>",
      "    <li>Fixed some performance issues also - in particular, significant improvements to \"Analysing Project...\" times when opening projects</li>",
      "    <li>The following types have been renamed: “Resource” is now “Asset”, “Mixed” is now “Any”, and  “ArgumentIdentity” is now “Any*”. Element Types are also now shown inside trailing angle brackets</li>",
      "    <li>Please see the full changelist lower down, as there are a lot more to be aware of!</li>",

      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Additional Control For Extensions</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    <li>Added a new system called Extension Options, which allows you to declare new fields in a dedicated new “Options” window in the Extension Editor</li>",
      "    <li>These new fields then appear to everyone using your extension on the main window of the Extension Editor, so they can be filled in very much like Instance Variables in the Object Editor</li>",
      "\t<li>In this way, people using your extension can set their in-game values inside the Extension Editor and their values are then saved per-Configuration, etc., by GameMaker</li>",
      "    <li>Added the ability to exclude extension functions from appearing in the Code Editor auto-complete pop-up</li>",
      "    <li>[Android] Implemented the ability to inject into gradle.properties</li>",

      "    <li>Opera GX's Game Options have been modified to make selecting which game is to be updated much easier, as GameMaker will now automatically retrieve information from the GX website - however, if you have previously uploaded any games, then you will likely need to check these values are set correctly in those projects before attempting to do your next builds, otherwise you might get a “Bad Data” error when uploading</li>",
      "    <li>Android YYC - The runner is now built using NDK 24, so we would recommend that you use this NDK version for all builds (NDK 24 is supported by earlier GM releases and indeed is already our recommended NDK on the setup FAQ, so you may be using this anyway)</li>",
      "    <li>PS5 SDK support updated to version 5.00 - you will need to change your SDK installation and GameMaker Preferences to match</li>",
      "    <li>PS4 SDK support updated to version 9.50 - you will need to change your SDK installation and GameMaker Preferences to match</li>",
      "    <li>Xbox GDK support updated to the \"March 2022\" version - you will need to change your SDK installation and GameMaker Preferences to match</li>",

      "    <li>Feather: Fixed what looked like a hang when parsing chained function calls larger than 6 calls [it was actually that it just took a long time to process the function chain - it’s now much faster and so you shouldn’t see any “stalls”]</li>",
      "    <li>Feather: Autocomplete window now appears when typing in the Visual editor or Inspector</li>",

      "    <li>Android YYC - The runner is now built using NDK 24, so we would recommend that you use this NDK version for all builds (NDK 24 is supported by earlier GM releases and indeed is already our recommended NDK on the setup FAQ, so you may be using this anyway)</li>",

      "<h3>Removed Some Legacy Platforms/Architectures</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Some lesser-used or largely redundant versions of the targets have now been removed, so we can focus support on the current tools instead. These are:</li>",
      "\t<li>Android x86 32bit architecture (x86_64 is still there, so you can still use 64bit emulators)</li>",
      "\t<li>UWP target has been removed entirely, as the Windows store has accepted native packages for a while and the GDK extension can be used to implement current versions of Microsoft’s social functionality</li>",
      "\t<li>Windows x86 (32bit support) architecture has been removed from Game Options, so now only 64bit executables are available</li>",
      "\t<li>Xbox One Legacy (XDK) target has been removed entirely, as GDK has been available for a while</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Resource Refactor And Project Saving Changes</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>This release introduces a big clean-up to how assets are handled, which should have very minor impact on how you work, but will make future releases far more stable</li>",
      "\t<li>Fixed a very important project-saving bug where if a script's source file had become locked (e.g., by an external process such as source control or Dropbox/GDrive/OneDrive, etc.) and therefore wasn't able to be read, then it was possible that Feather would incorrectly cause some <i>other</i> assets to be lost (typically Scripts, but not limited to this)</li>",
      "\t<li>Project loading will now also merge duplicate folders whenever they are detected in a .yyp file - so if you had a project which for some reason had gained duplicate folders in the Asset Browser, you should now find that simply opening the project in this version will clean that up (if you know that you have a project in this state it’s worth creating a backup before you open it, so that if you do have any issues you can send us the original version for investigation)</li>",
      "\t<li>Creating a new event in the Object Editor will now trigger an immediate save of your project, as this fixes multiple issues with source control status, but also when discarding other unsaved changes on closing GameMaker</li>",
      "\t<li>Case-insensitive file names are back - please be aware of this if you are moving projects between OS installations which use different naming conventions (or when committing into Git source-control repos)</li>",
      "\t<li>Fixed some memory management around loading assets, which will stop potential leaks and also fixes an issue with breakpoints failing to stay on the correct line in Object events if you later add other lines higher up in your code</li>",
      "\t<li>For each of the above points there may be minor changes to the file formatting/contents of some resources, so please be aware of this the next time you're committing to source control and if you see some unexpected changes</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Project Format Changes For Tile Layers In Rooms</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>We have introduced a new, much faster method for storing tile data in your rooms and passing this information into your builds - games which are using tile maps extensively in their designs may see a reduction in the size on disk of their projects, as well as a reduced load time</li>",
      "\t<li>This change also fixes a long-time compiler issue where projects containing rooms with lots of tile slots could see a pause on the line \"Found Project Format 2\" in their output log</li>",
      "\t<li>However, this new format is not compatible with older IDEs/runtimes and so accordingly we have introduced a new safeguard in this version, should you attempt to open a project in an older IDE again.</li>",
      "\t<li>On opening the project in any version newer than 2022.6 GameMaker will raise the project version automatically to be 1.6</li>",
      "\t<li>The next time a room containing a tile layer is edited in the newer IDE, this will potentially upgrade all the tile data and save it in a \"TileCompressedData'' variable in the room’s own .yyp file - at this point, this project cannot be loaded into previous IDEs as it won’t understand its tile layer information. (Any game built by the 2022.8 or later IDEs, but using a runtime from 2022.6 or older will also lack all this tile layer’s content, so please be careful using older runtimes.)</li>",
      "\t<li>Please note if the room wouldn't benefit from the compression, GameMaker will continue to store the data in the old-style \"TileSerialiseData\" variable - this is the same format as before and previous IDEs can open it if you need to; however, you will need to follow the steps in <a href=\"https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/4518066618129#h_01G8BB59TF9493M47YTAZX15CZ\" target=\"_blank\">our FAQ for opening “too new” projects in older IDEs</a></li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>More Effect Layer Types</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>New filters have been added for Contrast, Fractal Noise, Gradient, Colour LUT (\"Look-Up Table\"), and Twist Blur</li>",
      "\t<li>See the manual for more info and give them a try in the room editor to determine if they would be a good fit for your projects</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Additional Rollback Multiplayer Functionality And Visual Editor Fixes</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>New functions and a new Rollback event have been added for providing chat functionality to your players</li>",
      "\t<li>New Visual nodes have been added for the above, plus we added an optional “layer” field onto the Rollback Define Player node</li>",
      "\t<li>Toolbox icons have been also updated to the proper images for all the existing rollback nodes</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Added Opera GX Game Options SSO Account Label</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>In previous releases there was no indication/error given if a game registration failed because you were actually logged-in as a different SSO account in your browser to the one you had logged-into GM with</li>",
      "\t<li>Now, Game Options always tells you which account GameMaker will use to register/upload your games to (or if you're not actually logged-in yet), so you can more easily see when there is an upload fail due to a simple account mismatch</li>\t",
      "\t<li>Note: if you do happen to use multiple Opera accounts, then you should continue to make sure your web browser is signed-in to the one you need before doing any uploads</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Feather Functionality/Fixes</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Naming Rules now have a new value of \"Unconstrained\", which you can set to tell Feather to allow any naming convention when dealing with certain aspects of your code</li>",
      "\t<li>Added a new Preference for whether you want relaxed or strict type-checking (previous versions were “strict”, 2022.8 defaults to “relaxed” now)</li>",
      "\t<li>Also added a new Preference for controlling the amount of warnings Feather will show you in the code editor. You can now select between varying levels in the dropdown, which progressively enable more of the current warnings: \"None\" (which is compile errors only), \"Syntax Errors\" (which is syntax errors and compile errors),\"Type Errors\" (which adds variable type enforcement warnings), and \"All\" (everything Feather offers)</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather now does its parsing work on a separate application thread, so projects will load more quickly and should no longer cause \"stalls\"/\"freezes\" as you edit your projects or when renaming any scripts which contain functions referenced in multiple places elsewhere in your code - this last scenario will also no longer trigger an unwanted File Watcher dialog</li>",
      "\t<li>Fixed very poor general/overall IDE performance when thousands of Lint Messages are discovered</li>",
      "\t<li>Fixed some general performance issues with parsing scripts that contain a lot of JSDoc comments</li>",
      "\t<li>Syntax highlighting for tooltips now matches the colours/styling of the code editor</li>",
      "\t<li>You should also now find documents are fully code-coloured much more quickly after opening</li>",
      "\t<li>Added an option to prefer multi-line or single-line JSDoc style during generation</i>",
      "\t<li>Added support for sorting by Code/Message/Resource column values into the Messages window</li>",
      "\t<li>There are also a lot of other Feather fixes lower down in the release notes, so please do review them also</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Additional Extension Options Functionality</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Added combobox gadget support into the extension options editor and also the ability to mark settings as hidden to the “user-facing” options panel on the main Extension Editor window</li>",
      "\t<li>Added support for native-language Android and iOS extensions to access extension options values</li>",
      "\t<li>Added a button for reverting each “user value” on the main Extension Editor window to the default values provided on the Extension Options window</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Misc Important Changes To Be Aware Of</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>As you may have noticed already, the New Version popup now contains a \"Don't ask me again\" option - this will hide the popup until the <i>next</i> version is released</li>",
      "\t<li>Sound assets with invalid or non-existent underlying files were previously still included in game builds, but this of course would cause issues in-game if you tried modifying them later, so now you will be asked to fix all problem sounds before the build will succeed - again, to be clear, those sounds would not have worked correctly in-game in previous releases and our only change here is that you were not told this</li>",
      "\t<li>Similar to the above, the Room Editor “Stripes Background”,  \"Vignette\" and “LUT Colour Grading” filters will all now warn you during builds if your chosen sprite has not been marked in the Sprite Editor as being on a texture page by itself, and will expect you to fix this also - again, to be clear, this setting not being ticked caused various issues when drawing the filters in-game in previous releases, so now we are simply better communicating that the checkbox always needed to be set</li>",
      "\t<li>Added support for Android's \"ProGuard\" minifying and shrinking options, both of which can be used to reduce your game’s output package size and therefore the amount of data new players need to download when installing your game. You can now enable these settings in Game Options if you wish (they both default to off) and the corresponding steps will then be performed during your builds. Note that you cannot enable \"shrinkResources\" without also having \"minifyEnabled\" enabled, as the Android tools do not allow that (minify on its own is allowed). We also added $YYAndroidProguard as a tag so that your extensions can inject into the proguard.pro file.</li>",
      "\t<li>Made a fix where GM could crash when adding multiple files at once to the Included Files “Datafiles” directory outside GameMaker, but please note that the fix for this one means <i>empty</i> folders will no longer be shown in the Included Files editor window - they are still on disk just fine, but they won’t appear until you actually add some files into them</li>",
      "\t<li>Fixed that duplicating a layer in the Room Editor did not preserve all of its instances’ creation code on the new layer you made and so you had to copy the code manually later - now, all the code is copied for you, as you would expect</li>",
      "\t<li>The font used for Chinese in the Mac IDE has now been subtly changed, as the one we used is no longer included by Apple in recent macOS versions and so this could cause a number of issues when trying to draw font characters in various places within GameMaker</li>",
      "\t<li>When building projects, all .zip output packages have been changed to be encoded as UTF-8, which stops issues when non-ASCII characters have been typed in Included Files folder names (files inside that folder would then fail to be found in-game)</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Other Bugs Fixed</h3>",
      "<ul>  ",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: You are now able to delete multiple Tags at once in Quick Access</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Compiler should now be much faster and no longer stay on \"Found Project Format 2\" lines in the Output Windows for any projects containing lots of tile slots in rooms [see the tile-encoding change mentioned higher up]</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Fixed an issue where converting SWF files could fail with \"Attempted to divide by 0\" when trying to build project SaveNew...</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: No longer creates an empty Pre-Create event/file for any objects that don't actually need them [saves filesize and also in-game memory]</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Extension Options values are now expanded correctly before Android/iOS/tvOS code-injection</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Game Options > Windows values are now passed into NSIS builds correctly, so .exes will show the correct copyright, etc. information in Windows’ properties dialogs</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Removed all \"hobby licence\" functionality and splash screens from the runtimes</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Sound assets with invalid or non-existent underlying files are no longer embedded in the game, will error instead [see the longer explanation higher up]</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Switch builds again contain the IDE version number in their metadata (only 2022.6 lacked this)</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Texture pages are no longer rewritten every run, causing long build times (they were in 2022.6)</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Android] Deploying to an emulator at the end of a build when using recent Android SDK versions no longer results in a \"no device connected\" error</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Android] Projects are now able to clean their cache successfully whenever any path names are > 260 chars</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [HTML5] Global-scope macros which call in-built variables no longer cause a build error</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [HTML5] index.html is no longer included twice in the output package if a custom .html has been selected in Game Options</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Mac IDE] Building archives for iOS and tvOS now automatically opens Xcode Organiser when the build has succeeded</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Mac IDE] HTML5 and Android targets now automatically opens Finder when the build has succeeded</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [macOS] Fixed an issue where some special characters (such as apostrophes and brackets) were not escaped properly and so caused builds to fail</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Mac IDE] macOS YYC builds will no longer incorrectly claim a success <i>for the run part</i> when targeting a different CPU architecture to the local machine [the build itself should work fine, but as you’re using the wrong CPU it’s correct that the run part will always fail to launch the game]</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [OperaGX] Now correctly disables the Create Exe button immediately after starting a build, stops it being possible to have multiple builds/uploads running (which could also cause GM crash if too many started at once)</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Ubuntu YYC] The appimage is now correctly unpacked when the game is run from the IDE, which stops extensions failing to find files</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Ubuntu] Now able to build projects successfully when targeting a 22.04 LTS machine, as the \"Permission denied (publickey)\" 22.04 gave has now been fixed [20.04 LTS remains our suggested dev platform for now anyway]</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Windows] Fixed that builds could fail with a \"startIndex cannot be larger than length of string\" error if Windows is set to certain non-English language and region formatting styles combinations</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Xbox GDK] Added a new Preference for whether to always deploy the package after doing a Create Exe</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Xbox GDK] Fixed that cancelling a build manually did not always immediately re-enable the Create Exe button</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [YYC] Fixed that builds failed when defining a new function and giving it args for its parent constructor and a \"new\" constructor for a related child</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [YYC] Fixed that builds failed when struct member names are strings containing spaces</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [tvOS] Fixed that builds which trigger the \"Persistent Storage\" dialog would continue to fill your ui.log with silent and redundant errors until GM is next closed by you</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Fixed that calling <i>gml_pragma(\"PNGCrush\");</i> did nothing in the recent GM versions since we re-introduced PNG outputs</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (Visual): Fixed that the node for \"If Key Pressed (Rollback)\" converted to Code didn't do anything, because it never had code beyond creating and setting a temp variable to hold the key input state</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (Visual): Rollback node icons no longer all use the one \"dice\" image [see the Rollback section higher up for more]</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (Visual): Typing \"x\" and \"y\" in an instance's creation code editor will no longer also modify its Flip X/Y values in the room</li>",
      "\t<li>Note that there were actual several ways in which Room Editor commands could be accidentally triggered when typing in GML Visual editors which were open over the top of the room, and the fix above should resolve all of them</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (Visual): Using arrow keys whilst typing a comment incorrectly no longer switches the focus to a different node, will instead just move the caret as you would expect</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Footer no longer shows red after updating to a new GM version if a code editor was already open in your 2022.3 project layout</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Rollback variables \"player_id\" and \"player_local\" are now coloured as built-in variables</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Tab names now have the correct letter casing, rather than always only lowercase letters</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: [Windows IDE] Win+V dialog now pastes successfully from the clipboard</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: network_send_raw(), skeleton_animation_set() and skeleton_animation_set_ext() all now correctly have their final argument marked as optional in autocomplete</li>",
      "\t<li>Config Editor: No longer possible to open multiple editors at once, which could lead to incorrect values being saved in previous releases</li>",
      "\t<li>Debugger: Now displays the actual instance IDs and object type rather than raw references which were harder to understand what they meant</li>",
      "\t<li>Debugger: GM no longer hangs when debugging instance_create_layer() due to new \"ref\" type in 2022.6 / Debugger: GM no longer hangs when debugging projects which attempt to work with the new \"ref\" type in 2022.6</li>",
      "\t<li>Debugger: Originating code is now shown correctly when hitting a breakpoint located on a line which has } at the end</li>",
      "\t<li>Debugger: Fixed that sometimes the play button was not re-enabled after hitting a breakpoint</li>",
      "\t<li>Debugger: [Mac IDE] Maximised windows restored from a layout file are now correctly sized as soon as they appear (so no longer have to animate as it resizes to fix)</li>",
      "\t<li>Device Manager: [Mac IDE] Ubuntu hostname values are now automatically trimmed of any accidental whitespace at either end of the string, which stops \"Hostname not valid\" error when testing the connection to your newly-added device</li>",
      "\t<li>Device Manager: [Mac IDE] \"Launch Simulator\" for iOS and tvOS now launch the correct matching simulator every time, rather just asking Xcode to launch the last simulator used and therefore possibly being the wrong one for the platform being built that time</li>",
      "\t<li>Device Manager: [Switch] Fixed that \"Test Connection\" for a blank hostname always claimed it was successful because GameMaker attempted a check for USB-only EDEVs, but that check itself also required a fix - now, it the field is blank <i>and</i> no EDEV can be found on a USB port, then you get be the expected fail result</li>",

      "\t<li>Go To: Fixed that GM could crash when using the search assets functionality if the expected results failed to appear and so you repeatedly reopened Go To and performed the search again in an attempt to refresh the list [Note that you will now get a warning message if GM thinks there are any missing results - please send us your ui.log, the project itself, and a mention of what your search term was in a bug report if you see this new warning]</li>",

      "\t<li>Preferences: Fixed that if you were using the Chinese language option for IDE Language, then certain fonts (such as JetBrains) use a substitute font for their Chinese glyphs, but that other font was not refreshed when the “parent” font was selected, which resulted in missing characters inside various parts of GameMaker</li>",

      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>This release introduces a big clean-up to how assets are handled, which should have very minor impact on how you work, but will make future releases far more stable</li>",
      "\t<li>Fixed a very important project-saving bug where if a script's source file had become locked (e.g., by an external process such as source control or Dropbox/GDrive/OneDrive, etc.) and therefore wasn't able to be read, then it was possible that Feather would incorrectly cause some <i>other</i> assets to be lost (typically Scripts, but not limited to this)</li>",

      "\t<li>Case-insensitive file names are back - please be aware of this if you are moving projects between OS installations which use different naming conventions (or when committing into Git source-control repos)</li>",
      "\t<li>Fixed some memory management around loading assets, which will stop potential leaks and also fixes an issue with breakpoints failing to stay on the correct line in Object events if you later add other lines higher up in your code</li>",
      "\t<li>For each of the above points there may be minor changes to the file formatting/contents of some resources, so please be aware of this the next time you're committing to source control and if you see some unexpected changes</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Project Format Changes For Tile Layers In Rooms</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>We have introduced a new, much faster method for storing tile data in your rooms and passing this information into your builds - games which are using tile maps extensively in their designs may see a reduction in the size on disk of their projects, as well as a reduced load time</li>",
      "\t<li>This change also fixes a long-time compiler issue where projects containing rooms with lots of tile slots could see a pause on the line \"Found Project Format 2\" in their output log</li>",
      "\t<li>However, this new format is not compatible with older IDEs/runtimes and so accordingly we have introduced a new safeguard in this version, should you attempt to open a project in an older IDE again.</li>",
      "\t<li>On opening the project in any version newer than 2022.6 GameMaker will raise the project version automatically to be 1.6</li>",
      "\t<li>The next time a room containing a tile layer is edited in the newer IDE, this will potentially upgrade all the tile data and save it in a \"TileCompressedData'' variable in the room’s own .yyp file - at this point, this project cannot be loaded into previous IDEs as it won’t understand its tile layer information. (Any game built by the 2022.8 or later IDEs, but using a runtime from 2022.6 or older will also lack all this tile layer’s content, so please be careful using older runtimes.)</li>",
      "\t<li>Please note if the room wouldn't benefit from the compression, GameMaker will continue to store the data in the old-style \"TileSerialiseData\" variable - this is the same format as before and previous IDEs can open it if you need to; however, you will need to follow the steps in <a href=\"https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/4518066618129#h_01G8BB59TF9493M47YTAZX15CZ\" target=\"_blank\">our FAQ for opening “too new” projects in older IDEs</a></li>",

      "<h3>More Effect Layer Types</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>New filters have been added for Contrast, Fractal Noise, Gradient, Colour LUT (\"Look-Up Table\"), and Twist Blur</li>",
      "\t<li>See the manual for more info and give them a try in the room editor to determine if they would be a good fit for your projects</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Additional Rollback Multiplayer Functionality And Visual Editor Fixes</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>New functions and a new Rollback event have been added for providing chat functionality to your players</li>",
      "\t<li>New Visual nodes have been added for the above, plus we added an optional “layer” field onto the Rollback Define Player node</li>",
      "\t<li>Toolbox icons have been also updated to the proper images for all the existing rollback nodes</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Added Opera GX Game Options SSO Account Label</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>In previous releases there was no indication/error given if a game registration failed because you were actually logged-in as a different SSO account in your browser to the one you had logged-into GM with</li>",
      "\t<li>Now, Game Options always tells you which account GameMaker will use to register/upload your games to (or if you're not actually logged-in yet), so you can more easily see when there is an upload fail due to a simple account mismatch</li>\t",
      "\t<li>Note: if you do happen to use multiple Opera accounts, then you should continue to make sure your web browser is signed-in to the one you need before doing any uploads</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Feather Functionality/Fixes</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Naming Rules now have a new value of \"Unconstrained\", which you can set to tell Feather to allow any naming convention when dealing with certain aspects of your code</li>",
      "\t<li>Added a new Preference for whether you want relaxed or strict type-checking (previous versions were “strict”, 2022.8 defaults to “relaxed” now)</li>",
      "\t<li>Also added a new Preference for controlling the amount of warnings Feather will show you in the code editor. You can now select between varying levels in the dropdown, which progressively enable more of the current warnings: \"None\" (which is compile errors only), \"Syntax Errors\" (which is syntax errors and compile errors),\"Type Errors\" (which adds variable type enforcement warnings), and \"All\" (everything Feather offers)</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather now does its parsing work on a separate application thread, so projects will load more quickly and should no longer cause \"stalls\"/\"freezes\" as you edit your projects or when renaming any scripts which contain functions referenced in multiple places elsewhere in your code - this last scenario will also no longer trigger an unwanted File Watcher dialog</li>",
      "\t<li>Fixed very poor general/overall IDE performance when thousands of Lint Messages are discovered</li>",
      "\t<li>Fixed some general performance issues with parsing scripts that contain a lot of JSDoc comments</li>",
      "\t<li>Syntax highlighting for tooltips now matches the colours/styling of the code editor</li>",
      "\t<li>You should also now find documents are fully code-coloured much more quickly after opening</li>",
      "\t<li>Added an option to prefer multi-line or single-line JSDoc style during generation</i>",
      "\t<li>Added support for sorting by Code/Message/Resource column values into the Messages window</li>",
      "\t<li>There are also a lot of other Feather fixes lower down in the release notes, so please do review them also</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Additional Extension Options Functionality</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Added combobox gadget support into the extension options editor and also the ability to mark settings as hidden to the “user-facing” options panel on the main Extension Editor window</li>",
      "\t<li>Added support for native-language Android and iOS extensions to access extension options values</li>",
      "\t<li>Added a button for reverting each “user value” on the main Extension Editor window to the default values provided on the Extension Options window</li>",

      "<h3>Misc Important Changes To Be Aware Of</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>As you may have noticed already, the New Version popup now contains a \"Don't ask me again\" option - this will hide the popup until the <i>next</i> version is released</li>",
      "\t<li>Sound assets with invalid or non-existent underlying files were previously still included in game builds, but this of course would cause issues in-game if you tried modifying them later, so now you will be asked to fix all problem sounds before the build will succeed - again, to be clear, those sounds would not have worked correctly in-game in previous releases and our only change here is that you were not told this</li>",
      "\t<li>Similar to the above, the Room Editor “Stripes Background”,  \"Vignette\" and “LUT Colour Grading” filters will all now warn you during builds if your chosen sprite has not been marked in the Sprite Editor as being on a texture page by itself, and will expect you to fix this also - again, to be clear, this setting not being ticked caused various issues when drawing the filters in-game in previous releases, so now we are simply better communicating that the checkbox always needed to be set</li>",
      "\t<li>Added support for Android's \"ProGuard\" minifying and shrinking options, both of which can be used to reduce your game’s output package size and therefore the amount of data new players need to download when installing your game. You can now enable these settings in Game Options if you wish (they both default to off) and the corresponding steps will then be performed during your builds. Note that you cannot enable \"shrinkResources\" without also having \"minifyEnabled\" enabled, as the Android tools do not allow that (minify on its own is allowed). We also added $YYAndroidProguard as a tag so that your extensions can inject into the proguard.pro file.</li>",
      "\t<li>Made a fix where GM could crash when adding multiple files at once to the Included Files “Datafiles” directory outside GameMaker, but please note that the fix for this one means <i>empty</i> folders will no longer be shown in the Included Files editor window - they are still on disk just fine, but they won’t appear until you actually add some files into them</li>",
      "\t<li>Fixed that duplicating a layer in the Room Editor did not preserve all of its instances’ creation code on the new layer you made and so you had to copy the code manually later - now, all the code is copied for you, as you would expect</li>",
      "\t<li>The font used for Chinese in the Mac IDE has now been subtly changed, as the one we used is no longer included by Apple in recent macOS versions and so this could cause a number of issues when trying to draw font characters in various places within GameMaker</li>",
      "\t<li>When building projects, all .zip output packages have been changed to be encoded as UTF-8, which stops issues when non-ASCII characters have been typed in Included Files folder names (files inside that folder would then fail to be found in-game)</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Other Bugs Fixed</h3>",
      "<ul>  ",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: You are now able to delete multiple Tags at once in Quick Access</li>",

      "\t<li>Building Projects: Fixed an issue where converting SWF files could fail with \"Attempted to divide by 0\" when trying to build project SaveNew...</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: No longer creates an empty Pre-Create event/file for any objects that don't actually need them [saves filesize and also in-game memory]</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Extension Options values are now expanded correctly before Android/iOS/tvOS code-injection</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Game Options > Windows values are now passed into NSIS builds correctly, so .exes will show the correct copyright, etc. information in Windows’ properties dialogs</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Removed all \"hobby licence\" functionality and splash screens from the runtimes</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Sound assets with invalid or non-existent underlying files are no longer embedded in the game, will error instead [see the longer explanation higher up]</li>",

      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Mac IDE] HTML5 and Android targets now automatically opens Finder when the build has succeeded</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [macOS] Fixed an issue where some special characters (such as apostrophes and brackets) were not escaped properly and so caused builds to fail</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Mac IDE] macOS YYC builds will no longer incorrectly claim a success <i>for the run part</i> when targeting a different CPU architecture to the local machine [the build itself should work fine, but as you’re using the wrong CPU it’s correct that the run part will always fail to launch the game]</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [OperaGX] Now correctly disables the Create Exe button immediately after starting a build, stops it being possible to have multiple builds/uploads running (which could also cause GM crash if too many started at once)</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Ubuntu YYC] The appimage is now correctly unpacked when the game is run from the IDE, which stops extensions failing to find files</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Ubuntu] Now able to build projects successfully when targeting a 22.04 LTS machine, as the \"Permission denied (publickey)\" 22.04 gave has now been fixed [20.04 LTS remains our suggested dev platform for now anyway]</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Windows] Fixed that builds could fail with a \"startIndex cannot be larger than length of string\" error if Windows is set to certain non-English language and region formatting styles combinations</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Xbox GDK] Added a new Preference for whether to always deploy the package after doing a Create Exe</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Xbox GDK] Fixed that cancelling a build manually did not always immediately re-enable the Create Exe button</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [YYC] Fixed that builds failed when defining a new function and giving it args for its parent constructor and a \"new\" constructor for a related child</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [YYC] Fixed that builds failed when struct member names are strings containing spaces</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [tvOS] Fixed that builds which trigger the \"Persistent Storage\" dialog would continue to fill your ui.log with silent and redundant errors until GM is next closed by you</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Fixed that calling <i>gml_pragma(\"PNGCrush\");</i> did nothing in the recent GM versions since we re-introduced PNG outputs</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (Visual): Fixed that the node for \"If Key Pressed (Rollback)\" converted to Code didn't do anything, because it never had code beyond creating and setting a temp variable to hold the key input state</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (Visual): Rollback node icons no longer all use the one \"dice\" image [see the Rollback section higher up for more]</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (Visual): Typing \"x\" and \"y\" in an instance's creation code editor will no longer also modify its Flip X/Y values in the room</li>",
      "\t<li>Note that there were actual several ways in which Room Editor commands could be accidentally triggered when typing in GML Visual editors which were open over the top of the room, and the fix above should resolve all of them</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (Visual): Using arrow keys whilst typing a comment incorrectly no longer switches the focus to a different node, will instead just move the caret as you would expect</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Footer no longer shows red after updating to a new GM version if a code editor was already open in your 2022.3 project layout</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Rollback variables \"player_id\" and \"player_local\" are now coloured as built-in variables</li>",

      "\t<li>Code Editor: network_send_raw(), skeleton_animation_set() and skeleton_animation_set_ext() all now correctly have their final argument marked as optional in autocomplete</li>",
      "\t<li>Config Editor: No longer possible to open multiple editors at once, which could lead to incorrect values being saved in previous releases</li>",
      "\t<li>Debugger: Now displays the actual instance IDs and object type rather than raw references which were harder to understand what they meant</li>",
      "\t<li>Debugger: GM no longer hangs when debugging instance_create_layer() due to new \"ref\" type in 2022.6 / Debugger: GM no longer hangs when debugging projects which attempt to work with the new \"ref\" type in 2022.6</li>",

      "\t<li>Device Manager: [Mac IDE] Ubuntu hostname values are now automatically trimmed of any accidental whitespace at either end of the string, which stops \"Hostname not valid\" error when testing the connection to your newly-added device</li>",
      "\t<li>Device Manager: [Mac IDE] \"Launch Simulator\" for iOS and tvOS now launch the correct matching simulator every time, rather just asking Xcode to launch the last simulator used and therefore possibly being the wrong one for the platform being built that time</li>",
      "\t<li>Device Manager: [Switch] Fixed that \"Test Connection\" for a blank hostname always claimed it was successful because GameMaker attempted a check for USB-only EDEVs, but that check itself also required a fix - now, it the field is blank <i>and</i> no EDEV can be found on a USB port, then you get be the expected fail result</li>",
      "\t<li>Docs Integration: F1/MMB on a function name again opens the correct page (rather than just opening the manual's home page as it did in 2022.6.1)</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: \"delete\" now correctly flags GM1052 when called on constructor functions created by \"new\", which helps prevent unexpected in-game code errors</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: \"id\" in-built variable is no longer treated as read-only when assigned-to inside structs (e.g. \"self.id = 1;\"), which lead to incorrect GM1008 and GM1052 errors being raised in previous versions</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: \"player_id\" and all other rollback multiplayer variables no longer cause unexpected Error GM1013 messages</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: \"with\" loops can now recognise arbitrary expressions</li>",

      "\t<li>Feather: Anonymous functions declared in another function's parameter initialisation are now found correctly whenever referenced elsewhere in your code</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Autocomplete is now much better at showing all matching results when typing a partial word if that term also comes after a special character in the result name (e.g., \"lis\" in \"ds_list_create\" would not work in previous releases) - note, however, that Feather is cleverer than the old Syntax Errors and so may legitimately/deliberately not show you as many results, but this is because it has ignored unwanted matches</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Autocompletion windows no longer disappear/flicker when typing long identifiers near the end of a file</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Comparing \"shader_current\" to -1 is now correctly allowed</li>",

      "\t<li>Feather: GM no longer goes unstable when typing a dot after the square brackets of an array</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that GM1059 being raised against a function declaration line also blocked the parsing of that function's body, which stopped you from seeing other errors/warnings in that code</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: GM1061 (\"index might be out of range\") has now be removed as it was found to frequently give false-positives, which stopped it being useful in many situations</li>",

      "\t<li>Feather: Helper popups should now never cover the line of code the caret is on</li>",

      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that the Messages panel highlight/selection could become offset from the mouse cursor when scrolling through lots of messages</li>",

      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that valid syntax in the format <i>new (function () constructor { ... })()</i> or <i>new array[i]()</i> were both incorrectly marked as an error</li>",

      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that pre-increment operators following a semicolon were incorrectly parsed as if \";++\"</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed various issues with using Quick Fix to perform JSDoc generation: mangling of pre-existing comment style; missing out tabs/spaces; omitting preceding and trailing comments or whitespace; omitting pre-existing @ignore, @deprecated, and @context attributes; mangling union types; that it occasionally resulted in unexpected \"function not found\" errors; and that it was not available for anonymous functions assigned to variables or struct literal members</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that JSDoc generation also did not correctly reparse all affected scripts after a change</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Removed JSDoc generation support for a global-scope script’s return statement, as this is deprecated functionality (if you want this, instead declare a function inside that script)</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that Quick Fix occasionally did nothing when you asked it to work on static variable declarations</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that performing multiple Quick Fixes in a row followed by one Undo via control/command+z would undo all/several of those Quick Fixes rather than only the last one</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that Quick Fix suggestions did not appear inside function bodies</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that reassigning a macro to be an anonymous function created by \"new\" resulted in type-inference breaking</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that recommended names for assets did not always match the custom values set in Preferences for casing if a default prefix/suffix was set also [now, whatever you type in will always be used in the suggestion - regardless of whether or not your text matches the casing rule you selected]</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that rendering tooltips of enums with a lot of members did not fit into the IDE window - now only shows a maximum number at once</li>",

      "\t<li>GXC Integration: Game uploads no longer fail if the Game Options \"Game Name\" value contains an underscore or certain other special characters (however, there are still some character rules your names must follow, so you will now also get a message whenever your desired game name is not compliant)</li>",

      "\t<li>Go To: Fixed that GM could crash when using the search assets functionality if the expected results failed to appear and so you repeatedly reopened Go To and performed the search again in an attempt to refresh the list [Note that you will now get a warning message if GM thinks there are any missing results - please send us your ui.log, the project itself, and a mention of what your search term was in a bug report if you see this new warning]</li>",

      "<h3>Opera Account Settings Migration</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>In previous releases, if you used one email address for your GameMaker account and a different email for your Opera Account and you have already converted your GameMaker account to be an Opera account on our website, then this would cause your Preferences and Recent Projects, etc., to be “lost”, because GameMaker is now looking in a new folder for them</li>",
      "\t<li>This version will rename the original folder for you and avoid you having to “migrate” your settings manually; however, it will only do this if you have not converted already - if you have already converted your account and so this issue applies to you, please see <a href=\"https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/6893026074525\" target=\"_blank\">our FAQ for how to quickly and easily recover your settings</a></li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Changes To The Default Project Layout</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>The default project layout now includes the Inspector as a new left-hand dock (but of course it is freely movable and dockable) and no longer includes Recent Windows as a panel inside the right-hand dock</li>",
      "\t<li>Though the Inspector has been around for a long time already, we are now bringing it to the front and making it more relevant inside other editors</li>",
      "\t<li>Please note that any existing layouts in your projects are of course unaffected by this change, and so if you want to see the changes you can use Layout -> Reset Layout menubar option. (If you have a highly customised layout you use in your projects you may also want to use Save Layout and ensure you backup your current layout.)</li>",
      "\t<li>Recent Windows can still be opened from the Windows menubar entry and added to your project layout again if you wish</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Changes To How GameMaker Loads/Saves Game Options</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Up until now, GameMaker always treated the licence of the last person to open a project as <i>the definitive list of game options that project requires</i> - so if one team member has a lot of targets on their licence all of them would be configured and if the project was then shared with a new team member who only had Test, a lot of those options would be removed again</li>",
      "\t<li>Now, your options will “merge” - so if you have team members who have different licence types, the Game Options values will remain in the project and cover everyone’s licences</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>New Room Inspector And Changes To The Room Editor Layout</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>The new Room Inspector is how you will now access many of the settings for rooms</li>",
      "\t<li>Before, all of a room’s settings and its layers were cramped into a single panel; now, all of the settings are handled as part of the Inspector and the Layers panel is a dockable panel which can be detached and placed where you want</li>",
      "\t<li>The Inspector UI is also more dynamic/responsive and only shows certain functionality if it’s relevant (e.g., Inheritance settings are only shown in the Inspector if you are in a child room, rather than always being shown in the old Room Editor layout)</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>”Opera GX” Target Rebranded As “GX.games”</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>The target has always been part of a whole ecosystem of releasing your games on the GX.games site and sharing them with others (for free or as paid content), so this new name clarifies that</li>",
      "\t<li>If you have not had a look at <a href=\"https://gx.games\" target=\"_blank\">GX.games</a> and what it offers, please do check it out and play a few games, see if it’s a route you would like to take also</li>",
      "\t<li>You already have access to publish games on it (for free) as part of your Opera Account and you can also see <a href=\"https://gamemaker.io/en/tutorials/publish-to-gxgames-tutorial\" target=\"_blank\">our tutorial about what publishing on GX.games involves</a> if you want more info</li>",
      "\t<li>Also added a new \"os_gxgames\" constant (which duplicates the existing \"os_operagx\", so you do not need to change existing code) in order to be consistent in-game with this branding change</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>New Options For Texture Group Management</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>You will now find the texture groups editor has new controls for whether you want to split textures off into their own data files on disk during your builds, as this can be required by bigger games on some platforms which have memory caps on how much data you can have loaded at any moment (e.g., GX.games only allows 2GB)</li>",
      "\t<li>You can then use the matching 2022.9 runtimes to load/unload these groups in-game as you require</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>New Visual Node “Add Motion”</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>This new function takes a direction and speed and modifies the in-built hspeed and vspeed values accordingly - so you have the one node to manage, but can change several values at once behind-the-scenes (the node performs the following code: <i>hspeed += speed * dcos(direction); vspeed += speed * -dsin(direction);</i>)</li>",
      "\t<li>The new node will be part of an upcoming tutorial, so please keep an eye on <a href=\"https://gamemaker.io/en/tutorials\" target=\"_blank\">our tutorials website</a> for more information</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Misc Other Changes To Be Aware Of</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Opera Account users who have never logged-in on the website would see an unhelpful \"UID not present\" error message in previous releases - this is now the correct \"Please complete your profile\" message</li>",
      "\t<li>Opera Account login now has a proper error message when a timeout has happened, letting you know you simply need to try again</li>",
      "\t<li>Opera Account users would receive an unhelpful message in older GM versions when accidentally attempting to login by typing in their old username and password details - this message has now been improved to say your old details no longer work, now you have converted your account, and to simply use the Opera sign-in button instead</li>",
      "\t<li>The micro web server is now always stopped when the main IDE is closed, which stops a number of issues (such as “GameMaker is already running” when trying to install an update), but please be aware of this if you’re testing your games after closing GM itself</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Bugs Fixed</h3>",
      "<ul>  ",
      "\t<li>AnimCurve Editor: GM no longer goes unstable after deleting all curve content then closing and reopening the editor</li>",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: ALT+I to create a new included file resource works again, after being broken in 2022.8</li>",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: Duplicating a sound now correctly renames its new source audio file also, stops an error when later running the project [note that if you have an audio asset already in this state you might need to rename its source file manually one time]</li>",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: GM no longer crashes when attempting \"Add Existing\" for an asset which has a cyclic dependency in its original project</li>",
      "\t<li>Bookmarks: Bookmarks on a line of code now remember if they should reopen as a floating editor in the workspace, rather than always opening as a new code editor workspace tab on their own</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Mac IDE] [HTML5] Fixed being unable to build projects that contain a Spine sprite</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [macOS] Fixed being unable to build a project from the Windows IDE if it is larger than 2GB</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Xbox GDK YYC] Long path names can still require subst in the Visual Studio/GDK tools, so subst has been re-enabled for this target</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Xbox GDK] Explorer is now opened to the correct location when a build succeeds, rather than an unexpected subfolder</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Macro definitions which contain pre-increment operations no longer return a compile error</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Fixed that some 2022.8 projects failed to build/clean due to \"Value cannot be null. (Parameter 'key')\" asset compiler error in GMRoom</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Fixed that Supura… no longer builds in recent versions due to SWF files which worked in older GM versions now being marked as incompatible</li>",

      "\t<li>Code Editor: skeleton_skin_create() is now highlighted as an in-built function (Feather or Syntax Errors - both had the issue in 2022.8 and both are fixed now)</li>",
      "\t<li>Crash Reporter: GMWebServer.exe is not ended properly when closing the IDE, appears to sometimes incorrectly trigger the crash reporter [see the note higher up]</li>",
      "\t<li>Debugger: [Mac IDE] Fullscreen IDEs opening windowed debuggers restored from a layout file are now sized correctly (no longer results in a fullscreen debugger window with black bars to fill the gaps)</li>",
      "\t<li>Device Manager: [Mac IDE] \"Detect Browsers\" now detects the full application name for Opera GX correctly, so that browser can now be used as a target device when doing HTML5 builds</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: [Mac IDE] Now shows messages for all Objects correctly, rather than requiring each Object to be opened first before you were informed of its values</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: ArgumentIdentity variables passed to functions now promote their types correctly from the parameter type</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: array_create() return type is now correctly treated as Real, rather than always incorrectly treated as Any</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Code in the format \"var a=1, b=a+1;\" no longer results in an error that \"a\" was treated as out of scope when \"b\" tried to use it</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Creation of new assets or renaming existing assets now reparses the entire project correctly, fixes issues in previous releases with it missing new or old errors</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Now alerts correctly when two functions with the same name are in a script/event (as this is a compile fail and you will need to fix your code)</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Errors in timeline scripts no longer show a red cross image in the Feather Messages \"Resource\" column</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Can now open Timeline assets mentioned in the Feather Messages window by double-clicking them</li>",

      "\t<li>Feather: If an enum has the same name as an asset in the Asset Browser, the tooltip for the enum is now shown correctly (rather than always showing the asset's details, like previous releases did)</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Inner and outer scope hinting no longer breaks when names are reused</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Refactoring operations no longer mangles parentheses of function signatures and new expressions in some circumstances</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Rename identifier & Go To Issue now works correctly even when the Inspector is open</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Renaming a function now correctly refactors the function definition line as well, rather than only renaming all the uses of that function elsewhere in your code</li>",

      "\t<li>Project Saving: [Windows IDE] A dialog is now shown to you whenever GameMaker is unable to rename an asset because its file path on disk is too long [in previous releases this was only written to the ui.log, so you had to open that to see why the rename didn’t work]</li>",

      "<h3>New Runtime Modules Dialog For Customising Your Runtime Downloads</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>You will see a new dialog for this the first time you start this new version, so for more information on this dialog and how to use it, please see <a href=\"https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/7303279382173\" target=\"_blank\">our new FAQ all about it</a></li>",
      "\t<li>GameMaker now handles downloading just the specific modules you require from each runtime - you can select a minimal install suitable for your current OS, whichever modules you require just now, or “just give me everything” (which is what GameMaker has always done until now)</li>",
      "\t<li>You can modify these choices at any time by clicking the new button on the Runtime Feeds screen, but be aware that whilst the dialog will add additional modules okay, it will not remove any which were previously downloaded  - if you wanted to do that, you will currently need to modify the dialog settings and then delete your entire runtime folder, so that GameMaker will re-download just the bits you now want</li>",
      "<li>Preferences has also been changed so that downloading any runtime version manually will always ask if you want to activate it, regardless of where on that line you clicked when initiating the download (previously, you had to specifically click the version number in order to be asked)</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Offline Support When Signed-In Using Opera Account</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Up until this release, you were unable to use GameMaker offline if you had migrated your account and signed-in using the Opera Account single sign-in method</li>",
      "\t<li>You now can sign-in to a saved Opera Account session and carry on offline for the usual must-go-online-once-a-month requirement that GameMaker Accounts have long used</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Pinch-To-Zoom Has Been Re-Implemented</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>The Workspace can now be zoomed in and out on devices with touch inputs (like trackpads)</li>",
      "\t<li>Windows IDE, this is done via Ctrl plus one finger on the trackpad; Mac IDE, it’s a two-finger pinch gesture</li>",
      "\t<li>There is a new Preference to disable this feature if you don’t want it</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Image Editor Support For Pasting As A New Layer</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>The Image Editor now allows you to paste directly from your clipboard to a new layer</li>",
      "\t<li>This new layer will be automatically placed above the currently-selected layer and the pan tool will be auto-selected to immediately allow you to control the pasted content as you wish</li>",
      "\t<li>This is the default behaviour now, as there was a lot of feedback in favour of this change, but the previous “Paste-As-Brush” behaviour can be enabled again in Preferences if you want it</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Implemented Case-Insensitive Compatibility Mode For The Mac IDE</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>There has been an ongoing issue with case-sensitivity when working across different operating systems and changing an asset's character case when renaming it (and how this change of case might then effect external tools, such as git)</li>",
      "\t<li>An option has been added to allow you to disable these extra renaming checks, as it is quite performance-heavy</li>",
      "\t<li>(The same changes affect the Ubuntu IDE Beta also, as it behaves the same as the Mac IDE)</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Feather Additions</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Feather Now reparses scripts whenever they are edited outside GameMaker</li>",
      "\t<li>The new rule GM2064 will validate that initialiser struct variables have variable definitions for the target object (and its Quick Fixes will now create Variable Definitions for missing fields)</li>",
      "\t<li>GM1013’s Quick Fix behaviour has now been modified for creating an instance variable</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Device Manager Support For Opera GX Mobile Devices</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>You will likely see a new firewall prompt for this the first time you start this new version, so for more information on this functionality and how to use it, please see <a href=\"https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/7961446360221\" target=\"_blank\">our new FAQ all about it</a></li>",
      "\t<li>Added a new MQTT server for discovering Opera GX Mobile devices on your network, allowing you to just as easily test your GX games on your phone or tablet as you can on your desktop</li>",
      "\t<li>Simply scan the QR code inside Device Manager to connect the mobile device to GameMaker in seconds</li>",
      "\t<li>Note that your devices are only linked to that one instance of GameMaker and will be forgotten the next time you close GameMaker</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>More Room Editor Layers Functionality</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Old Film, Hue, Ripples, Blocks Background, Panorama Background and Parallax Background have all now been added into the Room Editor for you to use in your games</li>",
      "\t<li>Also added an indicator into the Layers Panel to show when any filter/effect has been used on a layer</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Code Editor Support For Binary Literals And Underscores In Numbers</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Binary literals can now be declared in the form 0b…. (same as the hex literal 0x… that GameMaker has supported for a while). For example: <i>var six = 0b0110;</i> or <i>var thirteen = 0b0100 | 0b1001;</i></li>",
      "\t<li>Also, integer, floating point, hex, and binary literals may now take an underscore to act as a visual separator. For example: <i>var integer = 100_000_000;</i> or <i>var float = 3_141.59;</i> or <i>var hexadec = 0xDEAD_BEEF;</i> or <i>var binary = 0b01101000_01101001;</i></li>",
      "\t<li>Note that this is a Code Editor and Compiler change only - there is no support for this in-game</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Misc Other Changes To Be Aware Of</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Gradle version has been updated to match the requirements of Android APIs 32+ [please see the runtime notes for a little more information]</li>",
      "\t<li>Debugger: The struct versions of \"activeTracks\" no longer uses the wrong order for \"colourmultiply\" track values [was actually that the in-game order was wrong and you might need to change your code, so please see the runtime note’s Change To Be Aware Of section for more information on this one]</li>",
      "\t<li>Licensing: Proxy server of incorrect type causes startup crash [additionally, the proxy server details field now blocks https addresses from being added and there is more logging also for if your setup <i>does</i> somehow still cause issues]</li>",
      "\t<li>Localisation: Our language csv files have now been updated to conform to RFC 4180 standard (and therefore escape special characters) - whilst you may not need to make any changes in your existing custom language files, you should be aware of this process change if you’re editing ours or making your own localisation spreadsheets from scratch in future</li>",
      "\t<li>Sequence Editor: It was never really exposed in the IDE, but there was a WIP asset track available in-game - this has now been removed, as the full in-game implementation was never done, and so if you were using this “hidden” track in your games you will now need to change your code accordingly</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Other Bugs Fixed</h3>",
      "<ul> ",
      "\t<li>AnimCurve Editor: [Windows IDE] GM no longer crashes when undoing all changes made to a newly-created curve</li>",

      "\t<li>Building Projects: [HTML5] Builds no longer fail for audio files which contain .png or other non-audio metadata, which also stops a method of GameMaker going unstable when reloading the project after failing that build</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [HTML5] Builds again work reliably when the Game Options’ \"path folder name\" has been changed from the default of \"html5game\" to anything custom [this was an issue in 2022.9 only]</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Ubuntu IDE] iOS YYC projects containing extensions no longer gives an incomplete Xcode project with missing .ext files</li>",

      "\t<li>Code Editor (Visual): In multicolumn layouts, using the arrow keys no longer affects all columns at the same time</li>",

      "\t<li>Debugger: Fixed that HTML5 games could fail to run (gives white screen) if invisible non-standard characters had accidentally been included in the project and therefore broke the obfuscation process</li>",

      "<h3>Project Format Changes For Tile Layers In Rooms</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>We have introduced a new, much faster method for storing tile data in your rooms and passing this information into your builds - which fixes a long-time issue where rooms with lots of tile slots could see a pause on the line \"Found Project Format 2\" in their output log</li>",
      "\t<li>However, this new format is not compatible with older IDEs/runtimes and so accordingly we have introduced a new safeguard in this version, should you attempt to open a project in an older IDE again.</li>",
      "\t<li>On opening the project in any version newer than 2022.6 GameMaker will raise the project version automatically to be 1.6</li>",
      "\t<li>The next time a room containing a tile layer is edited in the newer IDE, this will potentially upgrade all the tile data and save it in a \"TileCompressedData\" variable in the room’s own .yyp file - at this point, this project cannot be loaded into previous IDEs as it won’t understand it. (The project would also lack all the tiles information if you used a current IDE but with a runtime from 2022.6 or older.)</li>",
      "\t<li>Please note if the room wouldn't benefit from the compression, GameMaker will continue to store the data in the old-style \"TileSerialiseData\" variable - this is the same format as before and previous IDEs can open it if you need to; however, you will need to follow the steps in <a href=\"https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/4518066618129#h_01G8BB59TF9493M47YTAZX15CZ\" target=\"_blank\">our FAQ for opening “too new” projects in older IDEs</a></li>",

      "<h3>Additional Feather Functionality</h3>",

      "\t<li>New functions and a rollback event have been added for providing chat functionality to your players</li>",
      "\t<li>New Visual nodes have been added for the above, plus some others which were missing from earlier Betas - and Toolbox icons have been fixed for the existing rollback nodes</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Additional Feather Functionality</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Naming Rules now have a new value of \"Unconstrained\", which you can set to tell Feather to allow any naming convention when dealing with certain aspects of your code</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Additional Extension Options Functionality</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Added combobox gadget support into the extension options editor and also the ability to mark settings as hidden to the “user-facing” extension options</li>",
      "\t<li>Added support for native-language Android/iOS extensions to access your extension options values, as set in the IDE</li> ",

      "\t<li>Also added $YYAndroidProguard as a tag so that your extensions can inject into the proguard.pro file</li>",
      "\t<li>Included Files: GM crashes after adding multiple files at once to Datafiles directory [note that the fix for this one means <i>empty</i> folders wil no longer be shown in the Included Files editor window, but they are still on disk just fine]</li>",

      "\t<li>Building Projects: \"Stripes Background\" filter type will draw parts of other sprites in-game if the one chosen has not been set as on its own texture page [this actually is the same recommendation for several filter types, so now the IDE will warn you if your chosen sprite has not been marked as being on a textuire page by itself]</li>",

(The project would also lack all the tiles information if you used a current IDE but with a runtime from 2022.6 or older.)</li>",

      "\t<li>Now, Game Options tells you which account GameMaker will use to register/upload your games to (or if you're not actually logged-in yet), so you can more easily see when there is an upload fail due to a simple account mismatch</li>\t",

      "<h3>Misc Important Changes To Be Aware Of</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Added support for Android's \"ProGuard\" minifying and shrinking options - you can now enable these in Game Options if you wish (defaults to off) and the corresponding steps will then be performed during your builds </li>\t",
      "\t<li>Also added $YYAndroidProguard as a tag so that your extensions can inject into the proguard.pro file</li>",
      "\t<li>Included Files: GM crashes after adding multiple files at once to Datafiles directory [note that the fix for this one means <i>empty</i> folders wil no longer be shown in the Included Files editor window, but they are still on disk just fine]</li>",

      "\t<li>Building Projects: \"Stripes Background\" filter type will draw parts of other sprites in-game if the one chosen has not been set as on its own texture page [this actually is the same recommendation for several filter types, so now the IDE will warn you if your chosen sprite has not been marked as being on a textuire page by itself]</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Rollback variables \"player_id\" and \"player_local\" are not coloured as built-in variables</li>",

(The project would also lack all the tiles information if you used a current IDE but with a runtime from 2022.6 or older.)</li>",

(The project would also lack all the tiles information if you used a current IDE but with a runtime from 2022.6 or older.)</li>",

      "<h3>Restored Some Missing Fixes</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Project loading will now also merge duplicate folders whenever they are detected in a .yyp file - so if you had a project which for some reason had gained duplicate folders in the Asset Browser, you should now find that simply opening the project in this version will clean that up (if you know that you have a project in this state it’s worth creating a backup before you open it, so that if you do have any issues you can send us the original version for investigation)</li>",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: Moving a folder of assets into another folder will cause resource load failures</li>",
      "\t<li>Project Load: Room Editor background layer colour values are no longer reset to white when loading a project</li>",
      "\t<li>Project Save: GM no longer hangs for some users when renaming a script (stops unexpected File Watcher dialogs also) [a final part of this fix had been lost in 34]</li>",

      "<h2>2022.8.0.34</h2>",
      "<h3>Removed Some Legacy Platforms/Architectures</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Some lesser-used or largely redundant versions of the targets have now been removed, so we can focus support on the current tools instead. These are:</li>",
      "\t<li>Android x86 32bit architecture (x86_64 is still there, so you can still use 64bit emulators)</li>",
      "\t<li>UWP target has been removed entirely, as the Windows store has accepted native packages for a while and the GDK extension can be used to implement current versions of Microsoft’s social functionality</li>",
      "\t<li>Windows x86 (32bit support) architecture has been removed from Game Options, so now only 64bit executables are available</li>",
      "\t<li>Xbox One Legacy (XDK) target has been removed entirely, as GDK has been available for a while</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Resource Refactor And Project Saving Changes</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>This release introduces a big clean-up to how assets are handled, which should have very minor impact on how you work, but will make future releases far more stable</li>",
      "\t<li>Fixed a very important project-saving bug where if a script's source file had become locked (e.g., by an external process such as source control or Dropbox/GDrive/OneDrive, etc.) and therefore wasn't able to be read, then it was possible that Feather would incorrectly cause some <i>other</i> assets to be lost (typically Scripts, but not limited to this)</li>",
      "\t<li>Creating a new event in the Object Editor will now trigger an immediate save of your project, as this fixes multiple issues with source control status, but also when discarding other unsaved changes on closing GameMaker</li>",
      "\t<li>Case-insensitive file names are back - please be aware of this if you are moving projects between OS installations which use different naming conventions (or when committing into Git source-control repos)</li>",
      "\t<li>Fixed some memory management around loading assets, which will stop potential leaks and also fixes an issue with breakpoints failing to stay on the correct line in Object events if you later add other lines higher up in your code</li>",
      "\t<li>For each of the above points there may be minor changes to the file formatting/contents of some resources, so please be aware of this the next time you're committing to source control and if you see some unexpected changes</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Project Format Changes For Tile Layers In Rooms</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>We have introduced a new, much faster method for storing tile data in your rooms and passing this information into your builds - games which are using tile maps extensively in their designs may see a reduction in the size on disk of their projects, as well as a reduced load time</li>",
      "\t<li>This change also fixes a long-time compiler issue where projects containing rooms with lots of tile slots could see a pause on the line \"Found Project Format 2\" in their output log</li>",
      "\t<li>However, this new format is not compatible with older IDEs/runtimes and so accordingly we have introduced a new safeguard in this version, should you attempt to open a project in an older IDE again.</li>",
      "\t<li>On opening the project in any version newer than 2022.6 GameMaker will raise the project version automatically to be 1.6</li>",
      "\t<li>The next time a room containing a tile layer is edited in the newer IDE, this will potentially upgrade all the tile data and save it in a \"TileCompressedData'' variable in the room’s own .yyp file - at this point, this project cannot be loaded into previous IDEs as it won’t understand its tile layer information. (Any game built by the 2022.8 or later IDEs, but using a runtime from 2022.6 or older will also lack all this tile layer’s content, so please be careful using older runtimes.)</li>",
      "\t<li>Please note if the room wouldn't benefit from the compression, GameMaker will continue to store the data in the old-style \"TileSerialiseData\" variable - this is the same format as before and previous IDEs can open it if you need to; however, you will need to follow the steps in <a href=\"https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/4518066618129#h_01G8BB59TF9493M47YTAZX15CZ\" target=\"_blank\">our FAQ for opening “too new” projects in older IDEs</a></li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>More Effect Layer Types</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>New filters have been added for Contrast, Fractal Noise, Gradient, Colour LUT (\"Look-Up Table\"), and Twist Blur</li>",
      "\t<li>See the manual for more info and give them a try in the room editor to determine if they would be a good fit for your projects</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Additional Rollback Multiplayer Functionality And Visual Editor Fixes</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>New functions and a new Rollback event have been added for providing chat functionality to your players</li>",
      "\t<li>New Visual nodes have been added for the above, plus we added an optional “layer” field onto the Rollback Define Player node</li>",
      "\t<li>Toolbox icons have been also updated to the proper images for all the existing rollback nodes</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Added Opera GX Game Options SSO Account Label</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>In previous releases there was no indication/error given if a game registration failed because you were actually logged-in as a different SSO account in your browser to the one you had logged-into GM with</li>",
      "\t<li>Now, Game Options always tells you which account GameMaker will use to register/upload your games to (or if you're not actually logged-in yet), so you can more easily see when there is an upload fail due to a simple account mismatch</li>\t",
      "\t<li>Note: if you do happen to use multiple Opera accounts, then you should continue to make sure your web browser is signed-in to the one you need before doing any uploads</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Feather Functionality/Fixes</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Naming Rules now have a new value of \"Unconstrained\", which you can set to tell Feather to allow any naming convention when dealing with certain aspects of your code</li>",
      "\t<li>Added a new Preference for whether you want relaxed or strict type-checking (previous versions were “strict”, 2022.8 defaults to “relaxed” now)</li>",
      "\t<li>Also added a new Preference for controlling the amount of warnings Feather will show you in the code editor. You can now select between varying levels in the dropdown, which progressively enable more of the current warnings: \"None\" (which is compile errors only), \"Syntax Errors\" (which is syntax errors and compile errors),\"Type Errors\" (which adds variable type enforcement warnings), and \"All\" (everything Feather offers)</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather now does its parsing work on a separate application thread, so projects will load more quickly and should no longer cause \"stalls\"/\"freezes\" as you edit your projects or when renaming any scripts which contain functions referenced in multiple places elsewhere in your code - this last scenario will also no longer trigger an unwanted File Watcher dialog</li>",
      "\t<li>Fixed very poor general/overall IDE performance when thousands of Lint Messages are discovered</li>",
      "\t<li>Fixed some general performance issues with parsing scripts that contain a lot of JSDoc comments</li>",
      "\t<li>Syntax highlighting for tooltips now matches the colours/styling of the code editor</li>",
      "\t<li>You should also now find documents are fully code-coloured much more quickly after opening</li>",
      "\t<li>Added an option to prefer multi-line or single-line JSDoc style during generation</i>",
      "\t<li>Added support for sorting by Code/Message/Resource column values into the Messages window</li>",
      "\t<li>There are also a lot of other Feather fixes lower down in the release notes, so please do review them also</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Additional Extension Options Functionality</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>Added combobox gadget support into the extension options editor and also the ability to mark settings as hidden to the “user-facing” options panel on the main Extension Editor window</li>",
      "\t<li>Added support for native-language Android and iOS extensions to access extension options values</li>",
      "\t<li>Added a button for reverting each “user value” on the main Extension Editor window to the default values provided on the Extension Options window</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Misc Important Changes To Be Aware Of</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "    \t<li>As you may have noticed already, the New Version popup now contains a \"Don't ask me again\" option - this will hide the popup until the <i>next</i> version is released</li>",
      "\t<li>Sound assets with invalid or non-existent underlying files were previously still included in game builds, but this of course would cause issues in-game if you tried modifying them later, so now you will be asked to fix all problem sounds before the build will succeed - again, to be clear, those sounds would not have worked correctly in-game in previous releases and our only change here is that you were not told this</li>",
      "\t<li>Similar to the above, the Room Editor “Stripes Background”,  \"Vignette\" and “LUT Colour Grading” filters will all now warn you during builds if your chosen sprite has not been marked in the Sprite Editor as being on a texture page by itself, and will expect you to fix this also - again, to be clear, this setting not being ticked caused various issues when drawing the filters in-game in previous releases, so now we are simply better communicating that the checkbox always needed to be set</li>",
      "\t<li>Added support for Android's \"ProGuard\" minifying and shrinking options, both of which can be used to reduce your game’s output package size and therefore the amount of data new players need to download when installing your game. You can now enable these settings in Game Options if you wish (they both default to off) and the corresponding steps will then be performed during your builds. Note that you cannot enable \"shrinkResources\" without also having \"minifyEnabled\" enabled, as the Android tools do not allow that (minify on its own is allowed). We also added $YYAndroidProguard as a tag so that your extensions can inject into the proguard.pro file.</li>",
      "\t<li>Made a fix where GM could crash when adding multiple files at once to the Included Files “Datafiles” directory outside GameMaker, but please note that the fix for this one means <i>empty</i> folders will no longer be shown in the Included Files editor window - they are still on disk just fine, but they won’t appear until you actually add some files into them</li>",
      "\t<li>Fixed that duplicating a layer in the Room Editor did not preserve all of its instances’ creation code on the new layer you made and so you had to copy the code manually later - now, all the code is copied for you, as you would expect</li>",
      "\t<li>The font used for Chinese in the Mac IDE has now been subtly changed, as the one we used is no longer included by Apple in recent macOS versions and so this could cause a number of issues when trying to draw font characters in various places within GameMaker</li>",
      "\t<li>When building projects, all .zip output packages have been changed to be encoded as UTF-8, which stops issues when non-ASCII characters have been typed in Included Files folder names (files inside that folder would then fail to be found in-game)</li>",
      "</ul>",
      "<h3>Other Bugs Fixed</h3>",
      "<ul>  ",
      "\t<li>Asset Browser: You are now able to delete multiple Tags at once in Quick Access</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Compiler should now be much faster and no longer stay on \"Found Project Format 2\" lines in the Output Windows for any projects containing lots of tile slots in rooms [see the tile-encoding change mentioned higher up]</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Fixed an issue where converting SWF files could fail with \"Attempted to divide by 0\" when trying to build project SaveNew...</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: No longer creates an empty Pre-Create event/file for any objects that don't actually need them [saves filesize and also in-game memory]</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Extension Options values are now expanded correctly before Android/iOS/tvOS code-injection</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Game Options > Windows values are now passed into NSIS builds correctly, so .exes will show the correct copyright, etc. information in Windows’ properties dialogs</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Removed all \"hobby licence\" functionality and splash screens from the runtimes</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Sound assets with invalid or non-existent underlying files are no longer embedded in the game, will error instead [see the longer explanation higher up]</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Switch builds again contain the IDE version number in their metadata (only 2022.6 lacked this)</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Texture pages are no longer rewritten every run, causing long build times (they were in 2022.6)</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Android] Deploying to an emulator at the end of a build when using recent Android SDK versions no longer results in a \"no device connected\" error</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Android] Projects are now able to clean their cache successfully whenever any path names are > 260 chars</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [HTML5] Global-scope macros which call in-built variables no longer cause a build error</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [HTML5] index.html is no longer included twice in the output package if a custom .html has been selected in Game Options</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Mac IDE] Building archives for iOS and tvOS now automatically opens Xcode Organiser when the build has succeeded</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Mac IDE] HTML5 and Android targets now automatically opens Finder when the build has succeeded</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [macOS] Fixed an issue where some special characters (such as apostrophes and brackets) were not escaped properly and so caused builds to fail</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Mac IDE] macOS YYC builds will no longer incorrectly claim a success <i>for the run part</i> when targeting a different CPU architecture to the local machine [the build itself should work fine, but as you’re using the wrong CPU it’s correct that the run part will always fail to launch the game]</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [OperaGX] Now correctly disables the Create Exe button immediately after starting a build, stops it being possible to have multiple builds/uploads running (which could also cause GM crash if too many started at once)</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Ubuntu YYC] The appimage is now correctly unpacked when the game is run from the IDE, which stops extensions failing to find files</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Ubuntu] Now able to build projects successfully when targeting a 22.04 LTS machine, as the \"Permission denied (publickey)\" 22.04 gave has now been fixed [20.04 LTS remains our suggested dev platform for now anyway]</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Windows] Fixed that builds could fail with a \"startIndex cannot be larger than length of string\" error if Windows is set to certain non-English language and region formatting styles combinations</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Xbox GDK] Added a new Preference for whether to always deploy the package after doing a Create Exe</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [Xbox GDK] Fixed that cancelling a build manually did not always immediately re-enable the Create Exe button</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [YYC] Fixed that builds failed when defining a new function and giving it args for its parent constructor and a \"new\" constructor for a related child</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [YYC] Fixed that builds failed when struct member names are strings containing spaces</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: [tvOS] Fixed that builds which trigger the \"Persistent Storage\" dialog would continue to fill your ui.log with silent and redundant errors until GM is next closed by you</li>",
      "\t<li>Building Projects: Fixed that calling <i>gml_pragma(\"PNGCrush\");</i> did nothing in the recent GM versions since we re-introduced PNG outputs</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (Visual): Fixed that the node for \"If Key Pressed (Rollback)\" converted to Code didn't do anything, because it never had code beyond creating and setting a temp variable to hold the key input state</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (Visual): Rollback node icons no longer all use the one \"dice\" image [see the Rollback section higher up for more]</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (Visual): Typing \"x\" and \"y\" in an instance's creation code editor will no longer also modify its Flip X/Y values in the room</li>",
      "\t<li>Note that there were actual several ways in which Room Editor commands could be accidentally triggered when typing in GML Visual editors which were open over the top of the room, and the fix above should resolve all of them</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor (Visual): Using arrow keys whilst typing a comment incorrectly no longer switches the focus to a different node, will instead just move the caret as you would expect</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Footer no longer shows red after updating to a new GM version if a code editor was already open in your 2022.3 project layout</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Rollback variables \"player_id\" and \"player_local\" are now coloured as built-in variables</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: Tab names now have the correct letter casing, rather than always only lowercase letters</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: [Windows IDE] Win+V dialog now pastes successfully from the clipboard</li>",
      "\t<li>Code Editor: network_send_raw(), skeleton_animation_set() and skeleton_animation_set_ext() all now correctly have their final argument marked as optional in autocomplete</li>",
      "\t<li>Config Editor: No longer possible to open multiple editors at once, which could lead to incorrect values being saved in previous releases</li>",
      "\t<li>Debugger: Now displays the actual instance IDs and object type rather than raw references which were harder to understand what they meant</li>",
      "\t<li>Debugger: GM no longer hangs when debugging instance_create_layer() due to new \"ref\" type in 2022.6 / Debugger: GM no longer hangs when debugging projects which attempt to work with the new \"ref\" type in 2022.6</li>",
      "\t<li>Debugger: Originating code is now shown correctly when hitting a breakpoint located on a line which has } at the end</li>",
      "\t<li>Debugger: Fixed that sometimes the play button was not re-enabled after hitting a breakpoint</li>",
      "\t<li>Debugger: [Mac IDE] Maximised windows restored from a layout file are now correctly sized as soon as they appear (so no longer have to animate as it resizes to fix)</li>",
      "\t<li>Device Manager: [Mac IDE] Ubuntu hostname values are now automatically trimmed of any accidental whitespace at either end of the string, which stops \"Hostname not valid\" error when testing the connection to your newly-added device</li>",
      "\t<li>Device Manager: [Mac IDE] \"Launch Simulator\" for iOS and tvOS now launch the correct matching simulator every time, rather just asking Xcode to launch the last simulator used and therefore possibly being the wrong one for the platform being built that time</li>",
      "\t<li>Device Manager: [Switch] Fixed that \"Test Connection\" for a blank hostname always claimed it was successful because GameMaker attempted a check for USB-only EDEVs, but that check itself also required a fix - now, it the field is blank <i>and</i> no EDEV can be found on a USB port, then you get be the expected fail result</li>",
      "\t<li>Docs Integration: F1/MMB on a function name again opens the correct page (rather than just opening the manual's home page as it did in 2022.6.1)</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: \"delete\" now correctly flags GM1052 when called on constructor functions created by \"new\", which helps prevent unexpected in-game code errors</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: \"id\" in-built variable is no longer treated as read-only when assigned-to inside structs (e.g. \"self.id = 1;\"), which lead to incorrect GM1008 and GM1052 errors being raised in previous versions</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: \"player_id\" and all other rollback multiplayer variables no longer cause unexpected Error GM1013 messages</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: \"with\" loops can now recognise arbitrary expressions</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Adding an array into a map no longer shows an incorrect error (\"The type 'Array<Real>' appears where the type 'Id.DsMap' is expected\")</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Anonymous functions declared in another function's parameter initialisation are now found correctly whenever referenced elsewhere in your code</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Autocomplete is now much better at showing all matching results when typing a partial word if that term also comes after a special character in the result name (e.g., \"lis\" in \"ds_list_create\" would not work in previous releases) - note, however, that Feather is cleverer than the old Syntax Errors and so may legitimately/deliberately not show you as many results, but this is because it has ignored unwanted matches</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Autocompletion windows no longer disappear/flicker when typing long identifiers near the end of a file</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Comparing \"shader_current\" to -1 is now correctly allowed</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Console functions now all have the correct documentation and types in their tooltips and should be handled correctly</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Enum types as specified in JSDoc for parameters are now always respected thereafter, as Feather now assumes you know best - so do bear this in mind if you have accidentally typed the wrong value in your JSDoc!</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Expressions using accessors no longer give unexpected type errors which read as if the accessor was not being used</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed the drawing of function tooltips to now support any multi-line content which is defined in the JSDoc</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: GM no longer crashes when showing tooltip or auto-complete for expressions which contain recursive macros</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed inconsistencies in variable-resolution between auto-complete, tooltips, and Find All References</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed a crash in auto-complete and tooltips when resolving dot references from struct accessors into non-structs</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: GM no longer crashes with \"Non-Collection type cannot have element type\" error when enabling Feather in \"Test1\" project</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: GM no longer hangs for a second after every code edit in some projects/on some machines</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: GM no longer goes unstable when typing a dot after the square brackets of an array</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that GM1059 being raised against a function declaration line also blocked the parsing of that function's body, which stopped you from seeing other errors/warnings in that code</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: GM1061 (\"index might be out of range\") has now be removed as it was found to frequently give false-positives, which stopped it being useful in many situations</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: GM2043 is now correctly raised if an out-of-scope local variable is assigned to a new declaration of the same name</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Helper popups should now never cover the line of code the caret is on</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: If the JSDoc sets \"@returns Any\", that function's \"return\" command no longer always shows a warning about its type not being correct</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Immediate dot-access of a newly-defined struct literal no longer shows an unexpected Error GM1012 message</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Macro errors GM1038 and GM1051 are now always shown when the project's code causes them</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that macros were incorrectly marked as recursive in some cases, showing an unexpected GM1100 message</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that macros which define functions could result in failure to discover those functions when later used elsewhere in your code</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that per-Config macros did not rewrite correctly</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that the Messages panel highlight/selection could become offset from the mouse cursor when scrolling through lots of messages</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed multiple issues with interpreting arrays or structs created from passing an array into \"new\", such as that a Collection Type's Element Type was not promoted for arithmetic and binary infix operators</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that valid syntax in the format <i>new (function () constructor { ... })()</i> or <i>new array[i]()</i> were both incorrectly marked as an error</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Nullish operator Suggestion GM2061 is no longer shown when the code already has an \"else\" branch [fixes an issue where the Quick Fix action would incorrectly remove that \"else\" block in previous releases]</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that the output log could fill up with \"Unable to find function 'ent_player_Event_Create$$anon_function ...', which should exist!\" lines</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that pre-increment operators following a semicolon were incorrectly parsed as if \";++\"</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed various issues with using Quick Fix to perform JSDoc generation: mangling of pre-existing comment style; missing out tabs/spaces; omitting preceding and trailing comments or whitespace; omitting pre-existing @ignore, @deprecated, and @context attributes; mangling union types; that it occasionally resulted in unexpected \"function not found\" errors; and that it was not available for anonymous functions assigned to variables or struct literal members</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that JSDoc generation also did not correctly reparse all affected scripts after a change</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Removed JSDoc generation support for a global-scope script’s return statement, as this is deprecated functionality (if you want this, instead declare a function inside that script)</li>",
      "\t<li>Feather: Fixed that Quick Fix occasionally did nothing when you asked it to work on static variable declarations</li>",

      "\t<li>Preferences: Fixed that if you were using the Chinese language option for IDE Language, then certain fonts (such as JetBrains) use a substitute font for their Chinese glyphs, but that other font was not refreshed when the “parent” font was selected, which resulted in missing characters inside various parts of GameMaker</li>",
      "\t<li>Preferences: [SP] Fixed a typo in \"Reglas\" on Feather's Naming Rules section title</li>",

      "\t<li>You already have access to publish games on it (for free) as part of your Opera Account and you can also see <a href=\"https://gamemaker.io/en/tutorials/publish-to-gxgames-tutorial\" target=\"_blank\">our tutorial about what publishing on GX.games involves</a> if you want more info</li>",
      "\t<li>Also added a new \"os_gxgames\" constant (which duplicates the existing \"os_operagx\", so you do not need to change existing code) in order to be consistent in-game with this branding change</li>",

      "<h3>New Options For Texture Group Management</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>You will now find the texture groups editor has new controls for whether you want to split textures off into their own data files on disk during your builds, as this can be required by bigger games on some platforms which have memory caps on how much data you can have loaded at any moment (e.g., GX.games only allows 2GB)</li>",
      "\t<li>You can then use the matching 2022.9 runtimes to load/unload these groups in-game as you require</li>",

      "<h3>New Visual Node “Add Motion”</h3>",
      "<ul>",
      "\t<li>This new function takes a direction and speed and modifies the in-built hspeed and vspeed values accordingly - so you have the one node to manage, but can change several values at once behind-the-scenes (the node performs the following code: <i>hspeed += speed * dcos(direction); vspeed += speed * -dsin(direction);</i>)</li>",

      "\t<li>Opera Account login now has a proper error message when a timeout has happened, letting you know you simply need to try again</li>",
      "\t<li>Opera Account users would receive an unhelpful message in older GM versions when accidentally attempting to login by typing in their old username and password details - this message has now been improved to say your old details no longer work, now you have converted your account, and to simply use the Opera sign-in button instead</li>",
      "\t<li>The micro web server is now always stopped when the main IDE is closed, which stops a number of issues (such as “GameMaker is already running” when trying to install an update), but please be aware of this if you’re testing your games after closing GM itself</li>",
      "</ul>",
